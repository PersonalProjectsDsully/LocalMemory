Convert the following section from bullet points to flowing narrative prose.

SECTION TITLE: {section_title}

CURRENT CONTENT (with bullets):
{content}

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Transform ALL bullet points into complete, flowing paragraphs
2. Each paragraph should be 4-6 sentences
3. Use transitions between ideas
4. Maintain all the information but present it as a story
5. Add context and explanation to make points clearer
6. NO BULLETS OR LISTS in the output

Example transformation:
BEFORE: "- Python is easy to learn\n- It has simple syntax\n- Great for beginners"
AFTER: "Python stands out as an exceptionally accessible programming language for newcomers to coding. Its syntax closely resembles natural English, making it intuitive for beginners to understand and write. This simplicity doesn't come at the cost of power, as Python remains versatile enough for complex applications. These characteristics have made it the go-to choice for educational institutions teaching programming fundamentals."

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Add {needed_paragraphs} more detailed paragraphs
2. Each new paragraph should be 4-6 sentences
3. Expand on existing ideas with:
   - Specific examples
   - Deeper explanation
   - Context and background
   - Implications and connections
4. Maintain narrative flow between paragraphs
5. NO BULLET POINTS - only flowing prose

Topics to explore in the expansion:
- Real-world applications and examples
- Common challenges and how to address them
- Best practices and recommendations
- Connections to related concepts
- Future implications and trends

2. Start with context - why these findings matter
3. Present each finding with explanation and examples
4. Show relationships between findings
5. End with implications and significance

CURRENT CONTENT:

WRITE A COMPLETE LEARNING PATH SECTION WITH:

1. Opening paragraph (4-5 sentences): Explain why a structured learning path matters for AI education, 
   the challenges learners face without guidance, and the benefits of a systematic approach.

2. Philosophy paragraph (4-5 sentences): Describe the pedagogical approach - why certain topics 
   precede others, how foundational concepts build toward advanced applications, and the importance
   of balancing theory with practice.

3. For each learning stage, write a full paragraph (5-6 sentences each) covering:
   - What the learner will study and why it's positioned here
   - Key concepts and skills they'll develop
   - Recommended resources and why they were chosen
   - Expected outcomes and how to measure progress
   - How this stage prepares them for the next

4. Pacing paragraph (4-5 sentences): Discuss realistic timelines, how to adapt based on background,
   when to move forward vs. when to review, and maintaining motivation.

5. Conclusion paragraph (4-5 sentences): Address transitioning to advanced topics, continuing
   education, and joining the AI community.

Target: 600-800 words of engaging, helpful prose with NO BULLETS.
