While they describe various types and characteristics of AI agents, the coverage is predominantly centered on enterprise and automation contexts, with limited explicit categorization of AI agent types (e.g., autonomous vs. conversational) or core characteristics beyond automation and integration. The scope of overview, architectures, and functional distinctions is only partially addressed.",
