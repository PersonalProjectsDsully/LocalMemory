## Synthesis
The most relevant documents for identifying AI tools and frameworks for monitoring and alerting are Document 3 and Document 4, which discuss evaluation frameworks, cloud deployment, and AI workflows. Azure AI emerges as a key platform, with potential APIs and SDKs for automation, monitoring, and alerting. Document 1 provides additional context on cloud services and AI deployment tools. Document 2 and 5 are less directly related but offer insights into AI development and evaluation practices that could influence alerting strategies.

**Sufficiency Status:** partial
