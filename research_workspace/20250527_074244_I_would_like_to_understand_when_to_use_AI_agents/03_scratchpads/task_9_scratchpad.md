## Documents Analyzed
- Building Agents with Model Context Protocol - Full Workshop with Mahesh Murag of Anthropic
- General Knowledge Synthesis

## High Value Findings
1. Introduces Model Context Protocol (mCP) for building AI agents
2. Focuses on context management in agent development
3. AI agents: Autonomous systems capable of decision-making, learning, and adaptive behavior.
4. Sequential prompts: Step-by-step instructions executed in a predefined order.
5. Task characteristics: Complexity, adaptability requirements, real-time processing needs, and resource constraints.

## Insights
1. mCP may provide a framework for structuring agent interactions
2. Lacks explicit comparison with sequential prompts or task-specific criteria
3. AI agents excel in dynamic, unstructured environments requiring autonomy (e.g., negotiation, exploration).
4. Sequential prompts are effective for structured, rule-based tasks with clear input-output sequences.
5. Hybrid approaches may optimize performance by combining agent-based adaptability with prompt-driven control.
