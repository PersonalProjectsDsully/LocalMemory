## Documents Analyzed
- Creating Agents that Co-Create â€” Karina Nguyen, OpenAI
- General Knowledge Synthesis

## High Value Findings
1. Discusses AI research paradigms including next token prediction and scaling paradigms.
2. Mentions the role of pre-training and neural networks in AI agent development.
3. Sequential prompts refer to structured, step-by-step instructions provided to an AI system to guide decision-making.
4. AI agents are autonomous systems capable of making independent decisions based on learned patterns or rules.
5. Decision-making contexts involve scenarios requiring choices under constraints, such as resource allocation, problem-solving, or dynamic environments.

## Insights
1. The focus on 'next token prediction' suggests sequential processing, which may relate to sequential prompts.
2. The concept of 'co-creation' implies collaboration between humans and agents, but does not explicitly address alternatives to AI agents.
3. Sequential prompts excel in predictable, rule-based tasks where outcomes are deterministic.
4. AI agents may outperform sequential prompts in complex, ambiguous, or evolving environments requiring adaptability.
5. The viability of sequential prompts depends on task structure, variability, and the need for human oversight.
