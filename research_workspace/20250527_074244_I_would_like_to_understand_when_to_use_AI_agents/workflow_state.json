(e.g., ServiceNow, Zendesk, Freshdesk): Freshdesk\n- Would you prefer technical implementation details, case studies, or high-level strategic guidance?: Strategic frameworks\n- Do you have any constraints (e.g., budget, existing tools, compliance requirements) to consider?: I would like to use the existing ticketing service, and we can use python running locally on a computer that will run the Qwen 30b int 4 model at 32k context. Any python libraries can be installed and used. \n",
