# Clarified Research Request

Original Request: I would like to understand the best practices when integrating agents with a ticketing service for an IT MSP Team.

Clarifications:
- Are you focusing on human agents, AI/automation agents, or both?: I am focusing on both, where the AI Agent may triage the ticket to a human agent if they do not have enough information for the task. 
- Which ticketing service(s) are you using or considering? (e.g., ServiceNow, Zendesk, Freshdesk): Freshdesk
- Would you prefer technical implementation details, case studies, or high-level strategic guidance?: Strategic frameworks
- Do you have any constraints (e.g., budget, existing tools, compliance requirements) to consider?: I would like to use the existing ticketing service, and we can use python running locally on a computer that will run the Qwen 30b int 4 model at 32k context. Any python libraries can be installed and used.
