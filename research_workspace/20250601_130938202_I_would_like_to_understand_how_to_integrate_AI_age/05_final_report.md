### Types of AI Agents

Within the domain of AI agents, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques are prominent for deploying intelligent assistants capable of handling complex information retrieval tasks. RAG combines retrieval of relevant knowledge with generative models to produce contextually accurate responses.

**Technical Details:**
- RAG architecture typically involves a retriever component (e.g., vector search over knowledge bases) and a generator (e.g., transformer-based models like GPT).
- Example implementation: Building a RAG system for retail involves integrating a knowledge base with a transformer model to provide real-time, accurate customer support responses.

### Example: Building a RAG System

- **Knowledge Base:** Structured product information, FAQs, and support documentation.
- **Retrieval Component:** Implemented via Elasticsearch or FAISS for fast vector similarity search.
- **Generation Component:** Fine-tuned transformer models deployed via APIs.
- **Workflow:** User query → Retrieval of relevant documents → Contextual input to generator → Response delivery.

## Alternative AI Approaches

This section compares traditional AI systems with AI agents, establishing a baseline for their capabilities and typical applications.

### Traditional AI Systems

Traditional AI systems primarily involve rule-based or supervised learning models designed for specific, predictable tasks. Examples include:

- **Chatbot Platforms:** Solutions like Dialogflow, Microsoft Bot Framework, and IBM Watson Assistant facilitate automated conversational interactions, often with predefined intents and responses.
- **IT Service Management (ITSM) Platforms:** For instance, FreshService supports integrations via APIs and webhooks, enabling automation of routine tasks such as ticket creation and status updates.

**Technical Integration:**  
Compatibility with platforms like FreshService requires implementing RESTful APIs, configuring webhooks, and developing custom connectors. For example, integrating a chatbot involves setting up webhook endpoints to handle incoming requests and respond appropriately.
