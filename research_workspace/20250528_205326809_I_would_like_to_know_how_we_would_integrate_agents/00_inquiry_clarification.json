  "original_query": "I would like to know how we would integrate agents with our FreshService instance for our MSP team where we use Freshservice across our clients. I am looking for recommending solutions to customers, I if it is a query that is out of the agents ability, it should triage it to a human agent. It should also do all of the initial classification of the ticket. This will be running on a single computer with QWEN3 30b with about 32k of context, we can use any python libraries, we will be hosting the qwen model in LM studio and will make requests to it using the rest API.",
