## Summary

# Summary of "How Coding Agents Change Software Development Forever - Hailong Zhang"

## Overview  
Hailong Zhang discusses the transformative role of coding agents in software development, emphasizing their potential to automate routine tasks while enabling human-AI collaboration. The presentation highlights two types of AI agents—synchronous (e.g., GitHub Copilot) and asynchronous (e.g., GitHub bots)—and showcases a real-world example, "Guru," an AI agent that enhances unit testing. The talk underscores the shift toward AI-driven workflows and the importance of frameworks like "Agent OS" to scale agent development.

---

## Key Points  
- **Future of Software Development**: AI will handle routine tasks (debugging, testing, documentation), while humans focus on creative problem-solving.  
- **Human-AI Collaboration**: Two modes—**synchronous** (real-time tools like GitHub Copilot) and **asynchronous** (autonomous bots triggered manually/automatically).  
- **Guru Example**: An AI agent that automates unit test generation and management, reducing developer burden.  
- **Performance Metrics**: 50% of Guru’s PRs are merged, and 80% of tests are generated by AI, demonstrating practical efficacy.  
- **Agent Frameworks**: Building agents requires defining clear problems, datasets, model evaluation, and context-aware frameworks like "Agent OS" for scalability.  
- **Multi-Model Approach**: Different LLMs (e.g., GPT-40) are used for specific tasks, with human-labeled data improving accuracy.

## Quotes/Insights  
- *"The collaboration has two types: synchronous and asynchronous."*  
- *"50% acceptance rate for PRs is meaningful in real-world scenarios."*  
- *"Agents will become contributors in teams, not just tools."*  
- *"Building context for specific tasks (e.g., unit tests) is critical for agent performance."*

## Actionable Items  
1. **Define clear, doable problems** (e.g., unit testing) to guide agent development.  
2. **Build datasets and evaluation frameworks** for model training and testing.  
3. **Leverage multiple LLMs** for different stages of a task, optimizing performance.  
4. **Create agent frameworks** (e.g., Agent OS) to streamline development across software engineering tasks.  
5. **Embrace AI in workflows** by integrating synchronous and asynchronous agents.

[00:01] hi everyone in this presentation I'm
[00:04] going to talk about coding agents and
[00:06] how to work with coding
[00:08] agents this is my agenda first I'm going
[00:11] to talk about future of software
[00:13] development workflow and then I'm going
[00:15] to show you example of coding agent and
[00:18] this agent will boost the unit
[00:20] test and finally I'm going to dive
[00:23] deeper into how we solved real life
[00:26] problems with agents how we build agents
[00:32] generative AI has shifted a lot of
[00:33] things and people believe AI coding is
[00:37] going to be the future and we believe a
[00:41] lot of the routine Works will be handled
[00:43] by AI including entry level coding tasks
[00:47] debugging testing and operating but
[00:49] still I think the creative Works
[00:52] including product design architecture
[00:54] design and difficult issues still need
[00:58] to be handled by humans so it must be a
[01:00] human and AI agents collaborate together
[01:03] to solve problems in same workflow in
[01:07] the
[01:09] future the collaboration has two types
[01:12] first is synchronous and another one is
[01:15] asynchronous I think people may pretty
[01:17] familiar with the synchronous one GitHub
[01:20] co-pilot or
[01:22] cursor this is AI live inside your IDE
[01:25] and this AI Works simultaneously with
[01:28]  when you're typing it's working
[01:30] right
[01:32] so we have already had this kind of
[01:35] product for a long time since 2020 and
[01:38] it's getting mature since 2023 and
[01:42] rapidly grows 2024 and it's widely
[01:45] adapated today but the asynchronized one
[01:48] is pretty new and it's just started
[01:51] 2024 the asynchronized one is more like
[01:55] a bot inside your workflow for example
[01:57] GitHub bot and this bot can be triggered
[02:00] either manually or automatically and
[02:03] this bot will complete the task without
[02:05] human's attention fully autonomous and
[02:08] will submit a deliverable once it's done
[02:11] so it's totally different experience and
[02:13] these two types of agents are all
[02:16] important and I think people need all
[02:18] these kind of agents to solve the real
[02:21] life
[02:25] problems imagine this is your workflow
[02:27] in the future and the workflow we have a
[02:31] lot of AI agents small agents live
[02:34] inside your repos workflows in different
[02:37] stages to solve different problems
[02:39] including unit test including fixing
[02:42] bugs writing documents submit code
[02:44] reviews and releasing from these kind of
[02:47] tasks and so human can focus on more
[02:50] creative
[02:54] part next I'm going to show you a
[02:57] detailed coding agent which will boost
[02:59] unit
[03:01] test I think uni test is more important
[03:04] today than before because in a era a lot
[03:07] of code are generated by AI as we just
[03:11] talked if you're are using cursor you
[03:13] must be familiar with tab for each of
[03:15] the tab multiple lines of code in
[03:18] multiple parts of the file will be
[03:20] generated and it's very hard to for you
[03:22] to focus on every generation and you may
[03:25] Overlook something the coding speed is
[03:27] really really fast but it also easy to
[03:30] generate bugs so one of the way to solve
[03:34] the issue or prevented issue is to write
[03:36] unit test people talk about unit test
[03:40] people think unit test is important but
[03:43] when writing unit test people hates it
[03:45] yet developers every developers hates to
[03:47] write unit test so we build a guru an AI
[03:51] agent to help developers to write unit
[03:53] test and managing unit
[03:57] test this is a screenshot that pull
[04:00] request of unit test generated by Guru
[04:04] and the process is triggered either
[04:07] manually or automatically by a PO
[04:09] request when humans submit a pro request
[04:12] Guru will detect the change of the code
[04:14] and determine if this change needs more
[04:17] unit test or change existing unit test
[04:21] and the group will do the coding work
[04:23] writing the test and to run the test to
[04:26] make sure everything works and then
[04:28] prepare and submit a portal request
[04:30] including all the information showing in
[04:32] this screenshot the summary of the test
[04:35] and the coverage Improvement of the test
[04:37] the human need to review this PO request
[04:40] and determine if this unit test is good
[04:43] or not uh to merge into the to the
[04:48] repo let's look at the uh performance of
[04:51] Guru in production this is also a
[04:53] screenshot from GitHub it's a list of PO
[04:56] requests and as you can see over 50 % of
[05:00] the PO requests are merged and accepted
[05:03] by humans so 50% is not a very large
[05:06] figure and there are a lot of rooms to
[05:08] for improvement but I think in real life
[05:12] 50% is already meaningful in production
[05:14] and help solve a lot of
[05:18] problems and also Guru handles around
[05:22] 80% of the unit test itself in its own
[05:25] report we are using Guru every day and
[05:28] then most of our test are generated by
[05:32] Guru from the commits you can see Guru
[05:35] is already in in the count of commits
[05:38] GRE is already the first contributor in
[05:40] our team and we believe more and more
[05:42] agents will become contributors in
[05:45] people's rle this year
[05:49] 2025 next I'm going to dive a little
[05:52] deeper into how we build Guru to solve
[05:55] real life
[05:57] problems to build an agent I think the
[06:00] first and the most important thing is to
[06:03] define the problem itself a clear
[06:06] concrete and doable problem is crucial
[06:09] for example unit test is a problem but
[06:12] software engineering is not a
[06:14] problem and once we have the problem we
[06:17] need to build the data sets for the
[06:20] evaluation purpose and also the
[06:22] evaluation harness and then we work on
[06:25] llms building context and last we need
[06:29] agent or framework to orchestrate
[06:31] everything
[06:35] together as we all know agents work on
[06:37] top of LMS and G work on all Frontier
[06:40] models either it's from open AI
[06:43] anthropic deeps Google Etc and we
[06:47] evaluate the models on the different
[06:49] scenarios try to find the best model for
[06:52] each of the scenario that means even
[06:55] within the same job Guru may use
[06:57] different LMS for different
[07:00] stages and also we find two models to
[07:04] improve the performance for example we
[07:07] find two GPT 40 with human labeled unit
[07:09] test code to improve the generation of
[07:13] the test
[07:17] code building context in agents is
[07:20] really
[07:21] important and then we think it's it's
[07:24] necessary to build that context for
[07:26] specific tasks for example here in unit
[07:29] test we build the context for each of
[07:32] the languages and the Frameworks and we
[07:36] also gather all the information from
[07:38] environment for example the GitHub
[07:41] issues uh code reviews commits Pro
[07:43] requests read me code itself and all
[07:46] these information need to be gathered
[07:49] together and to be filtered and to be
[07:51] selected to fit into the
[07:56] context we talk about unit test a lot
[07:58] but our vision
[08:00] is not only unit test we want to build
[08:02] agents for different software
[08:04] engineering tasks for example the the
[08:06] refactor task the e2e test task it is
[08:10] almost import impossible for us to build
[08:13] every of the agents from scratch so we
[08:17] build the framework or we can call it
[08:19] agent operating system agent
[08:21] OS different tasks may share similar
[08:24] runtime similar tools similar context so
[08:28] we abstract the common
[08:31] infrastructure and this operating system
[08:33] will enable us to build agents in this
[08:36] domain in a really fast
[08:41] pace the agent era is coming let's
[08:44] Embrace agents in workflow thanks for
[08:47] watching
