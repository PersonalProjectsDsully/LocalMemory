# Comprehensive Summary of YouTube Video Transcript

## Overview  
Andy Tadman from Theory Ventures discusses how large language models (LLMs) can identify and automate high-volume, low-complexity jobs in the workplace. He emphasizes that LLMs excel in tasks requiring scale, outperforming humans and traditional rule-based systems, while also highlighting their role as co-pilots in complex, context-heavy workflows. The talk focuses on leveraging LLMs to transform repetitive, scalable tasks and improve efficiency across industries.

## Key Points  
1. **LLM Capabilities**:  
   - **Transformation**: Automate data processing (e.g., converting formats, extracting insights).  
   - **Synthesis**: Combine information from multiple sources to generate summaries or insights.  
   - **Reasoning**: Perform logical tasks, though they model data distributions rather than true reasoning.  

2. **Job Categories**:  
   - **High Volume, Low Complexity**: Tasks overwhelmed by scale (e.g., security alerts, customer support). LLMs outperform humans here.  
   - **Middle-Range Workflows**: LLMs act as co-pilots, handling specific tasks while humans manage context and priorities.  
   - **Complex, High-Context Jobs**: Humans remain central, with LLMs assisting in specific steps (e.g., drafting, research).  

3. **Examples**:  
   - **Drop Zone AI** (Security): Automates end-to-end investigation of security alerts, reducing human workload and improving accuracy.  
   - **Rule-Based Systems**: Outdated for handling edge cases, while LLMs scale more effectively.  

4. **Impact of LLMs**:  
   - In high-volume jobs, LLMs can be **10x more efficient** than humans, as they handle repetitive tasks without fatigue.  
   - LLMs disrupt jobs entirely when tasks are scalable and low-complexity.  

5. **Challenges**:  
   - High-complexity jobs require human oversight due to unwritten context, priorities, and nuanced decision-making.  
   - Domain-specific reasoning needs bespoke data to train LLMs effectively.

## Important Quotes/Insights  
- *"LLMs are superhuman in high-volume, low-complexity tasks because they scale without fatigue."*  
- *"The competition is no longer AI vs. human—it’s AI vs. previous-generation rule-based systems."*  
- *"Drop Zone AI’s agentic systems outperform humans in security investigations by eliminating typos, leveraging perfect memory, and handling all alerts."*  

---

## Actionable Takeaways  
- **Focus on high-volume, low-complexity jobs** for maximum impact (e.g., customer support, data entry).  
- **Invest in LLMs for workflow automation** where rules-based systems fail due to complexity.  
- **Build domain-specific LLMs** with tailored data to enhance reasoning in niche areas.  
- **Use LLMs as co-pilots** for complex tasks, enabling humans to focus on strategic decisions.

[00:00] hi I'm Andy tadman partner at Theory
[00:02] Ventures and today I'll be sharing our
[00:04] research on AI Automation in the
[00:06] workplace this is how we evaluate the
[00:08] best places for new startups to build
[00:10] and the best places for executives to
[00:13] invest you can ask an llm to do pretty
[00:15] much any job and it'll give it a shot
[00:17] personally I use AI assistance as my
[00:19] personal trainer as my primary care
[00:21] doctor and my Editor to name a few and
[00:24] for businesses we think it'll be the
[00:25] same will support sales teams customer
[00:27] teams Security Finance engineering and
[00:29] more
[00:30] but all jobs are not made equal the
[00:32] nature of different work means that llms
[00:34] will be much more disruptive in some
[00:35] areas compared to others so if you're a
[00:38] Founder deciding what area to build in
[00:40] or an executive deciding which function
[00:41] to invest in what should you
[00:44] do some quick context on Theory Ventures
[00:47] we're based in San Francisco and we
[00:48] invest in early stage companies building
[00:50] on new Innovations in data and machine
[00:52] learning both an infrastructure and an
[00:53] application layer we are very thematic
[00:56] and thesis oriented investors we spend
[00:58] most of our time doing research in areas
[01:00] like workflow Automation and we've
[01:02] talked to hundreds of buyers and
[01:03] Builders across different job
[01:06] categories so first let's think about
[01:08] what llms are good at all an llm is
[01:11] trained to do is to model the
[01:12] distribution of the data that it's
[01:13] trained on that creates three key
[01:16] emerging properties that really matter
[01:18] for workflow automation the first is
[01:20] transformation this is effectively
[01:21] taking information and converting it
[01:23] from one format to another could be from
[01:25] a PDF to a spreadsheet from a
[01:27] spreadsheet to an email or from an email
[01:28] to Json integrating and transforming
[01:31] data has historically been the largest
[01:33] blocker for most workflow Automation and
[01:35] llms effectively solve this problem so
[01:37] they're really
[01:39] powerful second is synthesis this is
[01:41] taking a lot of information and
[01:42] Distilling it down or answering a
[01:44] question for example at Theory we
[01:46] frequently use deep research platforms
[01:48] from Gemini and open AI which can
[01:50] summarize hundreds of websites to answer
[01:51] a question we have about some technology
[01:53] or market and last but not least is
[01:56] reasoning llms are pretty good at
[01:58] approximating human reasoning and
[02:00] decision- making it's important to note
[02:02] that well when an llm is reasoning it's
[02:04] just modeling the distribution of
[02:06] written reasoning data and one big
[02:08] challenge is that we as humans we
[02:09] usually don't write down our reasoning
[02:10] or all of the assumptions behind it so
[02:13] llms are really good at reasoning about
[02:15] what exists in training data that can
[02:17] include basic Common Sense stuff that's
[02:19] on stack Overflow or other support
[02:21] forums and increasingly lots of code and
[02:23] math and logic which can be
[02:24] programmatically generated at Large
[02:26] Scale domain specific reasoning like how
[02:29] a security analist or a lawyer or an
[02:31] accountant might think through a complex
[02:32] case we'll take more bespoke data
[02:34] collection which we think is actually a
[02:36] great differentiating Advantage for new
[02:39] companies and now like what does it mean
[02:41] to do a job thinking about automation
[02:43] you need to get really specific and when
[02:45] we research a new space we break down
[02:47] the workflows to a task or subtask level
[02:50] so here's an example in security
[02:52] operations an analyst might get an alert
[02:55] run a query or do some research to get
[02:57] more information transform or synthesize
[02:59] that result
[03:00] analyze it and then continue to iterate
[03:02] on those steps until they' reached a
[03:03] conclusion you can even break this down
[03:05] further like within the querying step
[03:07] they might choose a tool then write a
[03:08] query then debug errors a couple Notes
[03:11] One a job is not necessarily a single
[03:13] person could be done by multiple people
[03:15] throughout the team or it could be done
[03:17] by automated systems set up by people
[03:19] and we'll talk more about that later in
[03:21] the presentation and second a person's
[03:23] job isn't just the core task they work
[03:25] on they're all of the interpersonal
[03:26] stuff joining meetings Etc which are
[03:28] really important in the context of an
[03:29] organization we'll also talk more about
[03:31] that
[03:32] later so where do llms the most value we
[03:36] see jobs generally existing on a
[03:37] spectrum of volume and complexity there
[03:40] are very complex low volume jobs like
[03:42] strategic planning where people spend
[03:43] most of their time just thinking and
[03:44] coordinating with others there are jobs
[03:46] in the middle like customer support who
[03:48] handle a number of cases that are
[03:50] generally pretty straightforward but
[03:51] might include reasoning with a customer
[03:52] quering internal systems Etc and then
[03:55] there are jobs who have massive amounts
[03:57] of relatively simple tasks usually these
[03:59] are jobs where the primary interface is
[04:01] a task cue like a list of prospects in a
[04:03] CRM or a list of security alerts in the
[04:05] Sim or there ones where people are
[04:08] sending hundreds of repetitive emails or
[04:10] messages all the time like in supply
[04:11] chain
[04:12] operations llms will impact all of these
[04:15] jobs but differently on the more complex
[04:17] side we expect these systems will be
[04:19] mostly implemented as co-pilots even as
[04:22] the models improve doing these jobs
[04:23] requires so much context reasoning and
[04:25] priorities some written but most
[04:27] Unwritten and so for the foreseeable
[04:29] fure future we imagine that these
[04:30] workflows will still be driven mostly by
[04:32] humans who then delegate or accelerate
[04:35] some tasks with
[04:36] llms in the middle is core workflow
[04:39] automation this is where we think LMS
[04:40] can automate substantial or end to end
[04:42] workflows where humans are no longer in
[04:44] the driver seat but they require more
[04:46] complex configuration with expert
[04:48] knowledge and humans will still be
[04:50] helping out on a task by task basis
[04:52] either as a reviewer someone to escalate
[04:53] to Etc this is a really great category
[04:56] for AI automation across different areas
[04:58] we've researched we see a lot of jobs
[05:00] where 40 to 70% of day-to-day work can
[05:02] be automated but today we're going to
[05:04] focus on this category at the top where
[05:06] llms disrupt the job entirely we're
[05:09] really excited about this area so let's
[05:10] dig into what it
[05:12] means high volume relatively low
[05:15] complexity jobs will be the most
[05:17] transformed by llms because that's where
[05:18] they're already superhuman these are
[05:21] jobs that are hard because of scale
[05:23] teams just get overwhelmed by the volume
[05:25] and so in many cases there's just too
[05:26] many things to handle and so they build
[05:28] rules based automations and workflows to
[05:30] do it for them and that's really awesome
[05:32] for people building with AI because now
[05:34] your competition is no longer AI versus
[05:36] human it's AI versus previous generation
[05:39] of rules-based software and in many jobs
[05:41] where people think of llm systems as
[05:43] being 80 90% as reliable as a human in
[05:46] these kind of jobs an llm system can be
[05:48] 10 times better than a human ever could
[05:50] be because as long as they can do the
[05:52] task in the first place there's no
[05:53] difference for them doing it 10 or 100
[05:55] or a thousand times each day I'll give
[05:58] two examples now from different
[05:59] companies in the theory
[06:01] portfolio the first is Drop Zone AI in
[06:03] the Security operation space as
[06:05] companies grow they buy more security
[06:07] products Each of which generates more
[06:09] alerts and as the number of alerts grow
[06:11] the companies then need teams to monitor
[06:13] them and investigate if they're real to
[06:15] perform a remediation or if they're a
[06:17] false positive the problem is that there
[06:19] are just way too many alerts and so
[06:21] security analysts might only look at 1%
[06:23] and then build rules based systems to
[06:25] get rid of the rest you can see an
[06:27] example on the left hand side um it
[06:29] works well for simple stuff but all of
[06:31] the rules and workflows you need to
[06:32] maintain would really explode as you
[06:34] consider all the edge
[06:35] cases and then from an analyst
[06:37] perspective this is I believingly
[06:39] repetitive work they typically leave the
[06:41] role after 12 to 18 months and there's a
[06:43] shortage of about four million analysts
[06:45] globally dropstone has built agentic
[06:48] systems that perform end to-end
[06:50] investigations just like a human in many
[06:53] ways they're better than a typical human
[06:54] analyst they're experts in every query
[06:56] language they don't make typos they have
[06:58] near Perfect Memory
[07:00] but the key thing is they don't even
[07:01] need to be because humans don't even
[07:03] have time to look through all these
[07:05] alerts they just need to be better than
[07:07] the rules-based systems which is pretty
[07:09] easy they then provide 247 365 coverage
[07:13] unlike a human analyst and last but not
[07:15] least they can share learnings across
[07:16] customers so if there's a new kind of
[07:17] threat that comes in all of the
[07:19] customers in the network can immediately
[07:20] be able to identify and block
[07:23] it another example is in customer
[07:25] engagement like our portfolio company
[07:27] amp any app subscript description
[07:29] service or retail business wants to
[07:31] engage with its customers whether by
[07:33] text notifications or through inapp
[07:36] personalization and deciding what to
[07:38] send one user isn't that hard but
[07:39] deciding what to send a million users
[07:42] really is so to handle the volume
[07:44] marketing teams set up and manage
[07:45] different rules-based Journeys here's a
[07:47] sequence we'll send to new users this is
[07:50] what will push to a customer who left
[07:51] something in their cart there's an
[07:52] example of this interface on the left
[07:54] hand side but we know here that everyone
[07:57] has different preferences they might
[07:59] have different interests they might
[08:00] respond to different types of messaging
[08:02] maybe they prefer different channels
[08:03] different times of the day and today
[08:05] marketing teams might be able to manage
[08:07] a few cohorts of customers but designing
[08:10] the rules-based journeys across all of
[08:12] these variables would create a
[08:13] combinatorial explosion that would just
[08:15] be impossible for anyone to manage and
[08:17] they're also forced to evaluate the
[08:19] impact on a single metric like message
[08:21] clicks but they have no way to determine
[08:23] how a strategy might drive customer
[08:24] purchases a week later or subscription
[08:26] retention a month down the line amp on
[08:29] the right hand side has built agentic
[08:31] automation that explores what messaging
[08:33] to send to whom when and how marketing
[08:35] teams turn more into experimentalists
[08:37] where they craft hundreds of different
[08:38] variants and then let the AI system
[08:40] figure out how to distribute them and
[08:42] evaluate the impact on all of the users
[08:44] activities over time they show massive
[08:47] uplift in customer satisfaction and in
[08:49] engagement metrics whether transactional
[08:51] or retention based which makes sense
[08:53] because they're one toone personalized
[08:55] for each user versus bucketing that user
[08:57] along with 10 or $100,000
[09:00] others but even more than that because
[09:02] the agents are constantly running
[09:03] experiments of what to show to whom they
[09:05] help companies discover brand new
[09:07] cohorts and insights on their customers
[09:10] U one of their customers is a food
[09:11] delivery company and they found a bunch
[09:13] of users who were only responding to 11m
[09:15] or midnight messages which is later than
[09:17] they would ever typically message a
[09:18] customer because they were this new
[09:20] cohort of late night snackers that the
[09:21] company previously didn't know about
[09:24] that's a strategic asset that can be
[09:25] used by data science and product teams
[09:28] and another example of the unique
[09:29] capabilities of agentic systems at
[09:32] scale so what does this mean for
[09:35] organizations obviously people don't do
[09:36] their work on an island they work with a
[09:39] team and how will AI change how those
[09:41] teams work together we think about it at
[09:44] two levels first on the role level work
[09:47] shifts from completing tasks to
[09:49] reviewing the llm outputs whether as an
[09:51] improval workflow or escalation ones to
[09:54] maintaining these llm systems maybe
[09:56] updating workflows model instructions
[09:58] Data Systems to improve the overall
[10:00] performance and
[10:01] reliability and last doing higher order
[10:04] work that previously took a backseat to
[10:05] day-to-day operations like in
[10:07] strategy of course all of this work is
[10:09] higher level reviewing maintaining
[10:11] system strategy all require expertise
[10:13] and experience in the role but today
[10:16] most functions doing this high volume
[10:17] work are pyramid shaped the largest
[10:19] groups of employees are the junior level
[10:21] ic's we're completing the day-to-day
[10:23] tasks so when an llm system automates a
[10:27] substantial portion of this work we
[10:28] expect these organizations will need to
[10:30] one shrink because fewer employees are
[10:32] needed overall most of the work is
[10:33] automated and second to invert that the
[10:36] positions that do remain will be more
[10:38] managerial or Advanced so organizations
[10:40] will instead look like inverted pyramids
[10:42] or diamonds this causes a lot of
[10:45] questions and challenges for businesses
[10:46] which are today oriented around this
[10:48] pyramid structure for example how do you
[10:50] hire and train new employees if there
[10:52] aren't a lot of entry-level roles so
[10:54] it'll be an interesting type of
[10:55] challenge where we're looking to see how
[10:56] organizations respond over time
[11:00] as a recap when you're thinking about AI
[11:02] automating workflows you need to break
[11:04] jobs down to their fundamental tasks um
[11:07] understand that jobs exist on a spectrum
[11:09] of complexity and volume and that AI
[11:11] will be most disruptive in high volume
[11:13] low complexity tasks and last but not
[11:15] least surrounding context will determine
[11:17] how AI impacts teams and organizations
[11:19] which is important both for Founders
[11:21] looking to sell to these organizations
[11:22] and Executives looking to think about
[11:24] how these will be transformed by
[11:26] AI one last note for founders here we're
[11:29] exploring sort of Technology problem fit
[11:31] how well llm systems can do different
[11:33] jobs there are a whole variety of other
[11:35] factors that determine if an idea is
[11:37] good to build a business around like the
[11:39] severity of the paino the incentive
[11:40] alignment the market size and structure
[11:42] Etc happy to chat more about that if
[11:44] anyone's thinking about building an AI
[11:45] workflow
[11:47] automation thanks so much for taking the
[11:49] time you can reach me at this email here
[11:51] have a nice day
