## Summary

# Summary of "Ionic Launch: Opening the economy to AI agents"

## Overview  
Justin, CEO and co-founder of Ionic, introduces the company's mission to enable AI agents to interact with the economy, starting with e-commerce. The video highlights the limitations of current ad-based systems and proposes a shift toward dynamic, agent-friendly data ecosystems. Ionic aims to streamline transactions by allowing agents to make decisions and complete actions seamlessly, while also redefining monetization models to benefit merchants and developers.

---

## Key Points  
- **Problem with current systems**: Ad feeds are static, designed for human interaction, and not optimized for AI agents to perform actions like ordering services or purchasing products.  
- **Ionicâ€™s solution**: Build an ecosystem with merchant partnerships to access dynamic product data, enriched with reviews and contextual information.  
- **Agent-centric design**: Data is structured in formats (e.g., relational databases, vector stores) that agents can use directly, avoiding fragmented workflows.  
- **Transaction efficiency**: Enable agents to make decisions and complete transactions in one step, eliminating the need for users to switch platforms.  
- **Monetization shift**: Instead of charging consumers, merchants will pay for AI-driven consumer matching and transaction facilitation.  
- **Scalability**: Starting with e-commerce, the platform aims to expand to hotels, flights, and other services.

## Important Quotes/Insights  
- *"We need to change that Paradigm [from ads to actions]."*  
- *"Merchants will pay everyone in this room to help them find the right consumer."*  
- *"Agents should be able to do all these things in one simple step."*  
- *"Amazon will also pay you as well, just not as much."*

[00:14] um like I said I'm Justin CEO and
[00:16] co-founder of ionic and at ionic we're
[00:19] on a mission to help agents interact
[00:22] with the economy starting with
[00:23] e-commerce why uh well when we started
[00:27] working with agents we wanted them to be
[00:28] able to do things for us on our our
[00:30] behalf we wanted them to be able to
[00:31] order the Uber to the airport later
[00:32] today we wanted them to be able to find
[00:34] the perfect gift for mom for Mother's
[00:36] Day find the best hotel for that last
[00:39] minute weekend trip um and when we
[00:41] started working on those types of tasks
[00:42] and those types of problems we quickly
[00:44] ran into um a set of issues and what we
[00:48] learned is that for the last 30 years
[00:50] we've built a world for ads and not for
[00:52] actions agents we want them to do things
[00:55] on our behalf and so we need to change
[00:56] that Paradigm so let's give you an
[00:57] example you know kind of what that looks
[00:59] like so um code here on the left is the
[01:02] uh data feed for a product it's an ad
[01:06] that ad is static it's meant for a human
[01:08] to see it a human to click on it go
[01:10] somewhere else maybe go somewhere else
[01:12] after that learn some more come back and
[01:14] make a transaction happen um I don't
[01:16] know about you but I don't need my agent
[01:18] bouncing from site to site to do things
[01:20] for me I want it to all happen in one
[01:21] place uh and so what do that mean well
[01:24] it means in the future I want my agent
[01:26] to know that I don't wear an extra large
[01:27] shirt I wear a shirt that's measured 21
[01:29] in from the top to the bottom that I
[01:31] don't need a cotton blend I need 7%
[01:34] modal I need a certain percentage of
[01:36] cotton right so those are the types of
[01:38] things that we can have our agents do
[01:39] but where we're starting today these ad
[01:41] feeds on the left they don't even know
[01:43] if a product is in stock they don't know
[01:45] the shipping they're static they're not
[01:47] Dynamic so what are we doing um we're
[01:50] building ecosystem where we have
[01:52] Partnerships with hundreds of merchants
[01:54] uh they give us access to that product
[01:57] feed that they have and then we are
[01:59] using agentic workflow to enrich that
[02:01] data with the loop here on the bottom
[02:03] we're taking editorial product reviews
[02:06] anything else that we need or that your
[02:08] agent will find interesting and putting
[02:10] that all in one place importantly it's
[02:12] in the format that an agent wants to see
[02:14] whether that's a relational database a
[02:17] vector store a graphical database we'll
[02:19] continue to grow and and work with
[02:21] everyone here as as uh we continue to
[02:23] progress on on how that data should be
[02:26] accessed that's in all access via R API
[02:29] that API is live today and is usable by
[02:32] anyone in this room
[02:35] um but after we have the data in the
[02:38] right place to make a decision we then
[02:41] again like I said we don't need to be
[02:42] bouncing around we want that transaction
[02:44] to happen that action to happen right in
[02:46] the same layer and so from here you can
[02:48] see this example of me potentially
[02:50] finding headphones for my flight later
[02:52] today um and once we've made that
[02:54] decision my agents worked with me on my
[02:56] behalf we can just say yeah I want to
[02:59] check out and the payment token can come
[03:01] through and we can complete the
[03:03] transaction immediately that's the way
[03:05] it should be agents should be able to do
[03:07] all these things in one simple
[03:09] step um okay so we talked about better
[03:12] decisions we talked about better actions
[03:13] last part the secret we'll talk about
[03:16] better monetization um okay so consumer
[03:19] AI products I think I saw this tweet on
[03:21] the left the the week IID signed up for
[03:23] my fourth Pro subscription of the month
[03:26] and it just really resonated with me
[03:27] that we're not going to be able to
[03:28] charge consumers for our AI products a
[03:31] $20 a month subscription fee forever
[03:33] it'll work for the early adopters but
[03:34] it's not mass Market um the secret is
[03:38] that Merchants will pay everyone in this
[03:40] room to help them find the right
[03:43] consumer um and match them to the best
[03:46] products we're starting with e-commerce
[03:47] today again like I said eventually
[03:48] that'll be hotel rooms it'll be flights
[03:50] it'll be everything but um you know I'll
[03:53] give you an example we've seen some cool
[03:54] demos out there where people are sending
[03:56] agents out they're going they buy
[03:58] something on Amazon and we all clap and
[04:00] we reposted on Twitter and like yes that
[04:02] is cool but for that Merchant on the
[04:04] other side of the transaction they're
[04:05] just paying Amazon and they're getting
[04:07] Amazon's taking all the credit and so if
[04:09] we're going through the process of
[04:11] enriching a data feed and we're helping
[04:13] agents understand what consumers want
[04:15] and we're making better decisions happen
[04:17] and transactions happen instead of a
[04:18] merchant getting a yes you checked out
[04:21] from Amazon and that the end of the day
[04:24] they know what data was going out into
[04:26] the world what models saw it how they
[04:28] used it what the flow was the
[04:31] transaction took place and then they're
[04:32] able to understand from that customer
[04:34] the ongoing relationship and they're
[04:36] willing to pay for that and they'd
[04:37] rather pay you for that than Amazon um
[04:39] side note Amazon will also pay you as
[04:41] well just not as
[04:43] much um okay and so to get that started
[04:46] we've created relationships with
[04:47] hundreds of merchants um you can can
[04:49] work with them immediately today uh
[04:53] we've got a catalog that's already
[04:54] enabled with millions of SKS that it's
[04:57] AI native and it keeps growing um
[05:00] we're hiring if you want to work with us
[05:02] it's Justin or Owen at ionic Commerce if
[05:04] you want to get started check out the
[05:05] docs it's docs. ionic commerce.com thank
