## Key Points  
1. **Workshop Goals**:  
   - Demystify AI music generation and turn ideas into songs.  
   - Highlight opportunities for artists to use AI for distribution and income.  
   - Encourage experimentation with genres and tools like Sunno/Udio.  

2. **Personal Journey**:  
   - Phlo’s background as a self-taught songwriter and automation advocate.  
   - Used **split testing** (different artist names, cover art, marketing) to analyze song performance.  
   - Created pseudonyms (e.g., "pin names") with massive streams (e.g., 5M+ for instrumental tracks).  

3. **Tools & Techniques**:  
   - Focus on **Sunno** and **Udio** for AI-generated music.  
   - Mention of automating workflows with Python for music production.  
   - Polls and audience-driven content (e.g., pulling stems for mixing/mastering).  

4. **Audience Interaction**:  
   - Encourages participation via polls to tailor the session (e.g., advanced AI music extraction).  
   - Discusses the importance of understanding AI’s role in modern music creation.  

5. **Monetization & Distribution**:  
   - Passionate about helping everyday artists generate income through AI.  
   - Explores how AI can democratize music production and distribution.

[00:00] [Music]
[00:14] good morning everyone good
[00:18] morning um I'm excited to be here I I
[00:22] really have uh one main goal in mind and
[00:25] that's for this talk to be or this
[00:28] Workshop to be interactive I want it to
[00:30] be fun and I want you guys to walk away
[00:32] with something
[00:33] tangible um so I I we we can actually
[00:36] switch switch to the
[00:38] slides
[00:40] uh slideshow it should be live now if
[00:43] you guys want to go ahead and go to this
[00:45] link that I have up on the screen or use
[00:47] your phone to go to the QR code I have
[00:49] some notes for you guys at that
[00:51] URL um but but those are my stated goals
[00:54] for this Workshop I want to really
[00:57] probably start
[00:58] by uh asking you guys some questions so
[01:01] I can get some interactions going but
[01:03] I'm glad you guys came thank you for for
[01:04] for coming I really do appreciate it um
[01:08] the music stuff is something I have been
[01:11] into for a long time like lifelong
[01:12] musician artist uh but the AI music
[01:15] stuff is something I just started paying
[01:16] attention to um with with regard to the
[01:20] tools I'm going to show you today maybe
[01:21] about a month or so ago so basically
[01:24] what this Workshop is going to be about
[01:25] is I'm going to start with the insights
[01:27] that I've gained by like doing all the
[01:28] research over the last 30 days and then
[01:30] we'll get straight into the tool so you
[01:31] guys can again walk away with something
[01:34] tangible
[01:35] um let's start
[01:38] with okay by by I know it's early and
[01:41] and uh I'm still groggy myself so uh you
[01:45] know you don't have to necessarily go
[01:46] crazier here but by show of hands uh how
[01:49] many of you have ever used a music
[01:51] generation model period okay we got okay
[01:55] nice about half half you guys that's
[01:57] dope um
[02:00] by show of hands how many of you guys
[02:02] use I had someone in in the crowd
[02:04] already say that they used Boomie have
[02:05] you guys ever used Boomie before no no
[02:07] no Boomie okay that's you're OG if you
[02:09] use Boomie because it was from like two
[02:10] years ago but it was a music generation
[02:13] model that um was actually pretty cool
[02:16] but but didn't get as complex as the the
[02:18] music generation models we have today
[02:20] how many you guys have have how many of
[02:22] you guys have ever used uhso or udio by
[02:25] show of hands okay nice okay so you guys
[02:28] will be familiar with with what I'm
[02:29] going to do today
[02:30] uh hopefully I can show you guys some
[02:31] like Advanced prompting techniques at
[02:33] the least but for the most part that's
[02:35] those are the tools that we're going to
[02:36] uh be focused on um I was doing this
[02:40] earlier asking some of the AV crew what
[02:42] you guys favorite artists are my man
[02:44] here right right here in the middle if
[02:45] you could name uh your favorite artist
[02:47] of all time what would it be who would
[02:49] it
[02:50] be
[02:52] yes mil Davis okay and correct me if I'm
[02:56] wrong because that's a little bit out of
[02:57] my league like
[03:00] Blues R&B
[03:02] Jazz okay okay I think I have something
[03:04] special for you today then
[03:07] so uh let's let's
[03:10] start I can get
[03:13] into uh a little bit of what we're going
[03:15] to do as
[03:17] well and I I actually would like to say
[03:19] because I've already talked about my
[03:20] workshop goal what I would actually like
[03:22] to say is that um I am not a classically
[03:24] trained musician I I wrote my S my first
[03:27] song when I was 13 but I welcome any
[03:30] discourse you guys have in terms of like
[03:32] uh accuracy right so if you guys feel
[03:35] like uh you're actually wrong like I
[03:37] that's cool I welcome that and I
[03:39] actually have uh something for you on
[03:40] that link that I showed earlier where
[03:42] you can submit questions or comments
[03:44] live like Live while we're doing this um
[03:46] to either correct me or or submit a
[03:48] question or whatever so that that was
[03:50] one of the main things I wanted to say
[03:51] is like I'm I I try and be as accurate
[03:53] as possible but if I say something wrong
[03:55] you know feel free to call me out I'm
[03:57] I'm I'm comfortable with that I'm cool
[03:58] with that um um and actually let me make
[04:01] sure I have my stuff pulled
[04:05] up if you guys can go to this link
[04:08] there's a link on there that says poll
[04:10] if you guys can go uh fill out that poll
[04:12] I think there's like two or three
[04:13] questions on there uh if you guys could
[04:15] go to that link now and start submitting
[04:17] your answers I'd really really
[04:19] appreciate that because it it I again I
[04:21] want this to be really interactive but I
[04:23] also uh want to tailor it to
[04:25] specifically what you guys want to know
[04:26] about uh AI music generation
[04:32] so if you guys could make your way over
[04:33] to that link and and uh submit would
[04:36] really really appreciate appreciate
[04:39] it now I've done some housekeeping I can
[04:41] kind of get into um my journey here I
[04:46] would say I'm way more of a first of all
[04:48] my name is Flo as you guys may or may
[04:50] not know um I'm way more of a songwriter
[04:53] than like a softway engineer uh but I
[04:55] have a lot of respect for what you guys
[04:56] do I I I know enough python to be
[04:58] dangerous but
[05:00] I'm not really that good at uh software
[05:02] design or engineering um
[05:05] but I I over the pandemic uh took a lot
[05:08] of time out to learn how to write
[05:10] scripts and um I'm really really big
[05:12] into automation so I use Python for
[05:14] automation for a lot of my stuff daily
[05:16] personal life stuff uh and and uh stuff
[05:19] for work as well um the other thing I
[05:22] would say
[05:23] is I'm really really B into
[05:26] experimentation um Flo is actually my
[05:28] artist name and if you go on Google or
[05:31] YouTube or Spotify Apple music you can
[05:32] actually look me up and find my music uh
[05:34] but the truth is that like I have a very
[05:36] eclectic taste and I like have uh
[05:40] experimented in a lot of different
[05:41] genres so I
[05:44] um couple years ago I decided that I
[05:47] wanted to do some split testing which is
[05:49] pretty odd for an artist uh but I I did
[05:51] want to do some split testing and what
[05:52] what I really found out was that the
[05:54] same song under two different artists
[05:56] can behave wildly different can perform
[05:59] Wild L differently so I literally would
[06:01] take the same recording like I'm a
[06:02] self-taught engineer would record it my
[06:05] home or other Studios and upload it
[06:07] under two different artist names and
[06:09] depending on the cover art the marketing
[06:11] uh who you try and Target when you're
[06:13] when you're posting online in terms of
[06:14] the daily content I would see that songs
[06:16] would perform differently um so what I
[06:18] basically did was start uh creating
[06:21] these quote unquote pin names and
[06:22] putting out music that way and I
[06:24] actually have a pin name uh that has way
[06:26] more streams than my actual artist name
[06:28] so if you look up me as an artist don't
[06:29] have that many streams but I have a
[06:31] couple pin names that uh have been like
[06:33] viral I have one that's got like 5
[06:34] million streams over the last couple
[06:36] months uh and it's just instrumental
[06:38] music so I'm an artist that does like
[06:39] R&B and hip-hop but I've experimented
[06:41] with like EDM I actually have a song
[06:43] with some like country influence Believe
[06:44] It or Not uh so I've just experimented a
[06:47] lot um and and that's kind of how we got
[06:49] here today I was I like to say I was
[06:50] experimenting with uh multiple genres
[06:52] way before AI music got here but I I
[06:54] love AI music for for that
[06:57] reason um in this work will cover uh AI
[07:01] music generation and demystifying it I
[07:03] kind of like distilling better um but
[07:05] you know chbt gave me this word so I put
[07:07] in the
[07:09] slides um and we're going to get hands
[07:11] on with sunno and udio uh and talk about
[07:13] turning ideas into songs and and then uh
[07:16] actually I have a question about this
[07:18] later on but um I really want to talk
[07:20] about opportunities for using AR music
[07:22] I'm super passionate about like
[07:23] distribution um and and for like regular
[07:26] everyday artists to be able to make um
[07:28] an income from from their music so if
[07:30] any of you guys are actually artists
[07:32] like I would love to get into those type
[07:34] of uh
[07:36] discussions
[07:37] um let's see have you guys did anybody
[07:40] actually fill out the thing that I was
[07:42] asking about let's
[07:44] see I'm
[07:46] disconnected
[07:48] break uh leg because I really can start
[07:51] throwing in little tidbits here and
[07:52] there about
[07:55] um what you guys want to learn about I
[07:58] put one like one of the options that I
[07:59] put for the poll is like an advanced
[08:00] option where we can like actually pull
[08:02] down some of the music that sunno is
[08:04] generating uh get stems for that that
[08:06] music and start to like mix and master
[08:09] um so I don't know if you if any of you
[08:10] guys would actually be interested in
[08:11] that but I put that as that' be great
[08:14] yeah okay awesome yeah that was the
[08:16] hardest thing about uh preparing for
[08:18] this is like I just don't know exactly
[08:19] who's going to be in the crowd and what
[08:20] like what level are they're at so I
[08:22] tried to like uh come up with a couple
[08:24] different tracks just for this this uh
[08:26] presentation alone but um yeah I just
[08:28] needed you guys feedack back so oh nice
[08:30] we did get a bunch of submissions and it
[08:32] looks like um prompt techniques okay
[08:36] tweaking a lot of promp techniques okay
[08:39] cool I have this guy that I call like
[08:40] the prompt Master how many You by show
[08:43] of hands how many of you guys are in the
[08:44] suo OR udio Discord server nobody oh
[08:47] yeah oh you're in there okay nice yeah
[08:49] even for you I think I'll have a treat
[08:50] cuz like uh there's a couple people in
[08:51] there that have posted uh since the
[08:53] beginning of uh sunno and udio and then
[08:57] there's this one guy who's like been
[08:58] able to do some really really cool like
[08:59] banjo music and bagpipe music that's
[09:02] insane but hit the prompts are very
[09:04] unintuitive in my opinion so you kind of
[09:05] have to see it to you know understand
[09:07] what it's
[09:09] doing um so we'll definitely get into
[09:11] the I'll make sure that I include a lot
[09:13] of prompting stuff thank you for
[09:14] everyone that just came in I appreciate
[09:16] you guys
[09:18] joining
[09:20] um right so this actually gets
[09:22] [Music]
[09:24] into you might notice that I you might
[09:27] notice that I okay hey did actually work
[09:30] but I I still might play it for my
[09:31] computer
[09:33] so this is where we start with the
[09:36] insights that I've learned by studying
[09:38] AI music and how it got to this point
[09:40] over the last uh couple months and then
[09:44] I'll get into it it it's uh kind of
[09:46] painful but I have to play some videos
[09:47] for you for you guys to catch up to
[09:48] where I'm at in terms of like
[09:50] understanding and how this whole thing
[09:51] developed um so we'll have some videos
[09:53] to watch but maybe five or six minutes
[09:55] of of of videos um
[10:01] when people say AI
[10:04] music I think that could mean a lot of
[10:06] different
[10:08] things and when I first started doing my
[10:11] research uh it was really frustrating
[10:13] that someone everyone everyone meant
[10:16] something slightly different so what
[10:18] I've tried to do is
[10:19] compartmentalize the definitions of AI
[10:21] music and tidy like I guess really tidy
[10:24] up the definitions cuz there was a lot
[10:26] of like Blurred Lines when I started
[10:27] doing the research um um and and the way
[10:30] that I I uh compartmentalized this was
[10:33] to say that we have uh text to music uh
[10:36] where you're generating short short
[10:38] samples um and full songs using text
[10:41] text prompts you have um audio to music
[10:43] and this is where you're taking an
[10:44] existing sound and transforming it into
[10:46] into uh actual music and you have like
[10:49] style transfer uh which is basically
[10:51] voice conversion um and voice conversion
[10:54] is actually the first thing that came
[10:55] across uh when I found AI music uh last
[10:59] year actually so it's been like a long
[11:01] time coming but I didn't really start
[11:02] doing the research until recently but I
[11:04] think what most people call AI music is
[11:07] really actually just voice conversion
[11:09] well it's hard to say that now but maybe
[11:11] when I started doing research it was but
[11:13] but I would say that
[11:15] um the the general
[11:18] consumer what they call AI music is is
[11:20] is mostly just style transfer where
[11:21] someone like took their voice and
[11:23] converted to another voice and that
[11:25] actually gets into the first video and
[11:26] I'll go ahead and play it now
[11:29] you guys may have seen this video it's
[11:31] actually pretty cool text to
[11:37] music
[11:44] oh you might notice that I sound like
[11:46] Kanye West no could we uh turn it up
[11:49] just a little bit in the house cuz this
[11:52] one's a little bit low he gets a little
[11:53] louder later but you you'll catch
[11:57] it you might notice that I sound sound
[11:59] like Kanye West no Yeezy didn't record a
[12:01] voice over for me for this video I
[12:03] didn't learn how to do Impressions this
[12:05] is AI so let me come back to my original
[12:07] voice for a second because this is crazy
[12:09] today on metaverse I posted AI Kanye
[12:12] covering popular song here's an example
[12:14] of him singing
[12:17] daying mind so that's clearly crazy and
[12:20] I started thinking you know what are the
[12:21] implications of this for the music
[12:23] industry now all you have to do is
[12:24] record reference vocals and replace it
[12:26] with the train model of any musician you
[12:28] like which is what I did I found this
[12:30] Kanye style beat on YouTube I wrote
[12:32] eight bars and I'm going to record them
[12:34] now and then I'm going to have ai Kanye
[12:36] replace me I got a fantasy that's
[12:39] beautiful that's dark and twisted but I
[12:41] attack the whole religion all because of
[12:44] my ignorance what was I thinking that
[12:46] was some [ __ ] [ __ ] I lost Adidas but
[12:48] I'm still Yeezy back in the kitchen man
[12:50] I'm a genius boys in the hood just like
[12:52] I'm easy Kanye Weezy southside of
[12:54] Chicago life ain't easy all praise be
[12:57] the Lord Jesus da please rest easy all
[13:00] right let me cut it there let me cut it
[13:01] there so let's hear those vocals I just
[13:03] recorded now with Kanye over them I got
[13:05] a fanty that's beautiful that's dark and
[13:08] twisted but I attacked the whole
[13:10] religion all because of my ignorance
[13:12] what was I thinking that was some [ __ ]
[13:14] [ __ ] I lost a deers but I'm still Yeezy
[13:16] back in the kitchen man I'm a genius
[13:18] boys in the hood just like I'm easy
[13:20] Kanye weey southside of Chicago life
[13:22] ain't easy all praise be the Lord Jesus
[13:25] D please rest easy all right let me cut
[13:28] it there let me cut it there
[13:29] yo that new so you guys kind of get the
[13:32] uh the gist of what he was doing there
[13:33] but I think um a lot of times when we
[13:35] hear a music AI music uh that's what it
[13:38] is it's like someone taking uh the the
[13:41] regular songwriting process where you go
[13:43] get production or do the production
[13:44] yourself uh you write the lyrics and
[13:46] then record your own vocals and then
[13:49] what people are calling AI music is
[13:50] really just style transfer or voice
[13:51] conversion where they're taking that
[13:53] voice and turn it into someone else's so
[13:55] this is actually the first shout out to
[13:57] this guy's name's Roberto Nixon if not
[13:59] mistaken and I saw this video and it
[14:01] kind of I think it just definitely
[14:03] changed the trajectory of of what I was
[14:05] doing at the time I dropped everything
[14:06] was like I have to figure out how the
[14:07] heck he just did this Kanye West uh
[14:09] voice thing uh so I I pretty much uh
[14:12] followed uh the steps in this video I
[14:14] dove into some Discord servers and some
[14:16] subreddits and that's how I really
[14:18] figured out how to uh do this for myself
[14:20] um so so I think uh that's that's one
[14:23] compartment that I've kind of like
[14:24] created for AI music and put it um uh to
[14:27] the side the another one or actually I
[14:30] have a couple more examples of of this
[14:31] as well let
[14:35] me I think if the the next one is how
[14:38] many of you guys were familiar by show a
[14:40] hands how many of you guys heard that
[14:41] Drake AI song that went viral last year
[14:44] okay we got a couple people nice um so I
[14:47] I'll play it I don't want to play the
[14:48] whole thing but again this is another
[14:50] example of uh voice conversion and a lot
[14:52] of people were saying oh my God he
[14:54] pressed a button and generated a whole
[14:55] Drake song and that's not really the
[14:56] truth uh this kid is his name is ghost
[14:58] rer the the person behind the song and
[15:00] he did an interview where he talked
[15:01] about the process of uh creating the
[15:03] song and it was all him except for the
[15:05] actual vocals he like changed his voice
[15:06] to sound like Drake in the weekend I'll
[15:08] play a little bit of
[15:19] it with my like
[15:22] thep just be able to F and left she know
[15:27] what she need her need she blessed give
[15:31] my best I got my heart I'mma stay with a
[15:34] knife my back what's with that 21 I love
[15:39] my brother
[15:40] that's to be it so you know that
[15:43] [Music]
[15:50] it's that's actually my favorite part
[15:52] but I'm going cut it
[15:53] off um so the Drake song was interesting
[15:57] to me cuz I kind of saw it unravel like
[16:00] I I think I found the video or heard the
[16:01] song when it was like under a thousand
[16:03] views uh being posted in some of those
[16:05] sub subreddits that that I was talking
[16:06] about uh but it went super viral I think
[16:08] he got like 9 million streams in the
[16:10] first 24 hours he was on his way this
[16:12] guy uh Ghost Rider was on his way to
[16:14] charting of course before the Raa got a
[16:16] hold of it and was like we're shutting
[16:18] this down so he got dmca and the song
[16:20] got wiped from everywhere uh you can
[16:22] still find it on the internet but it it
[16:23] pretty much got wiped from everywhere
[16:25] and uh I just thought like man this is
[16:27] really going to change everything but
[16:29] again everybody was calling it and
[16:30] saying it was AI music without uh being
[16:33] specific about what kind of AI music it
[16:35] was um so I have a couple more videos to
[16:37] show you guys but I just wanted to go
[16:40] over the Drake one cuz I thought that
[16:41] was pretty cool this next one is
[16:43] actually my favorite example of voice
[16:45] conversion that I've seen to date let me
[16:48] backtrack a little bit these two songs
[16:50] that I just played or videos that I just
[16:52] played are from a rough roughly a year
[16:54] ago I think March of last year April of
[16:56] last year since then the voice
[16:58] conversion tools have gotten 10 times
[17:00] better and like CU When I listened to
[17:02] the Kanye West one back then it was
[17:04] amazing it literally blew my mind no no
[17:06] lie and today I kind of listen to it and
[17:08] I'm like wow it sounds it's really artif
[17:09] facty it's bad it doesn't exactly sound
[17:11] like a natural human Kanye West but
[17:13] today they have stuff that sounds almost
[17:15] exactly you know like Kanye West I think
[17:18] and I say the kids because when I joined
[17:19] the Discord server it was literally a
[17:21] bunch of like 14 15 16 year olds doing
[17:23] this uh the these conversions um but uh
[17:27] the kids have gotten a lot better like
[17:30] uh training training uh these um models
[17:33] these voice
[17:34] models so the next one is actually my
[17:36] favorite uh example of voice conversion
[17:39] how many by show of hands how many of
[17:40] you guys in here are familiar with Randy
[17:43] Travis yeah I knew I was goingon to get
[17:45] y'all back there yes sir yes sir okay so
[17:48] Randy Travis uh and forgive me because
[17:51] I'm not exactly sure how this happened
[17:52] but he lost his voice some time ago and
[17:56] uh Randy Travis and his team kind of saw
[17:58] this AI thing unraveling or an unfolding
[18:01] and decided to sit down write a song uh
[18:04] produce a song and then use this voice
[18:06] conversion technique for uh Randy to
[18:09] sing the song without him actually
[18:10] singing the song so this is one of my
[18:12] favorite examples I think also in the
[18:14] last year or so
[18:16] the the not maybe temperament is not the
[18:20] best word
[18:22] but the general public opinion about AI
[18:25] music has shifted a little bit it hasn't
[18:27] gotten too much better it's really taboo
[18:28] honestly
[18:29] like I was a little bit uh nervous about
[18:31] doing this conference cuz like people
[18:32] just do not like AI music at all don't
[18:33] want in their lives but since then this
[18:36] this R Randy Travis song came out a
[18:38] couple of months ago or a couple weeks
[18:40] ago I think it
[18:41] was and when I looked at the YouTube
[18:44] comments of this video the feedback was
[18:47] overwhelmingly positive people were like
[18:49] in the comments saying I'm I'm a 75y old
[18:51] man I'm balling tears right now
[18:53] listening to this Randy Travis song um
[18:55] like they were like I we don't care how
[18:56] we get Randy as long as we get them back
[18:58] well take AI or not you know what I mean
[19:00] so it's just was uh a really cool
[19:03] example of I think how voice conversion
[19:05] can be used in in the right way you know
[19:06] by by the original artist so I'll go
[19:07] ahead and play some of this as well
[19:22] [Music]
[19:54] hello hello okay sorry I apologize to
[19:56] the radio Travis fans and then back I'm
[19:57] I'm G cut them off a little bit cuz I I
[19:59] do want to keep it going but um even
[20:01] though I'm not super into country music
[20:03] I I I thought it was really touching
[20:04] that he was able to like get with his
[20:05] team and use uh AI to uh to create um
[20:09] new original music I thought that was
[20:10] really cool uh so that that pretty much
[20:13] uh takes care of the style transfer
[20:14] stuff I've showed you guys some examples
[20:16] the next thing I want to get into is uh
[20:18] text to music um and I'll go over full
[20:22] songs as opposed to uh um uh the the
[20:26] short samples that I was talking about
[20:27] if you uh go again just want to remind
[20:30] you guys if you go to the link AI
[20:33] talk.com music and submit a question on
[20:35] there I can see it pop up on my screen
[20:37] um so I can like answer it in in uh in
[20:39] motion I also want to repeat it out loud
[20:41] for the transcription and all that good
[20:43] stuff um okay
[20:46] so text to music text to music text to
[20:49] music I'm going to show you guys a
[20:49] couple examples the way I I broke text
[20:52] to music down even a a little bit
[20:54] further uh
[20:56] by having I I have a couple folders here
[20:59] and I think the way I did text to music
[21:01] was yeah me meme songs and samples okay
[21:05] by show of hands how many of you guys
[21:06] have heard about this Drake and uh
[21:08] Kendrick Lamar beef going on okay dang
[21:11] okay y'all y'all are up on game I
[21:13] appreciate yall okay um
[21:18] so for anyone who hasn't been paying
[21:20] attention just know that one man said
[21:23] very disparaging words about another man
[21:26] and then the internet ran with it so I
[21:27] don't have to catch you on 18 million
[21:30] songs that these men have recorded now I
[21:33] couldn't even keep up with myself to be
[21:34] honest with you um but but yeah so so
[21:37] basically the internet ran with this
[21:38] whole concept of BBL Jersey and Kendrick
[21:41] Lamar set a lyric in one of these this
[21:42] songs that they had back and forth over
[21:44] the last couple weeks where he called
[21:45] Drake BBL Jersy if I I don't want to
[21:47] explain BBL to y'all I ain't going to
[21:49] lie to you um so hopefully you
[21:51] understand what a BBL is and they call
[21:52] him BBL Jersey and it's funny because
[21:54] like uh it can be taken a couple
[21:57] different ways but I'll just play the
[21:58] music so I'm not rambling too
[22:05] [Applause]
[22:06] [Music]
[22:09] [Applause]
[22:11] [Music]
[22:12] much I'm going
[22:17] in no
[22:21] did I'm
[22:23] [Music]
[22:24] [Applause]
[22:26] going D
[22:29] my Grandma will probably cuss me off for
[22:31] turning that off early but I'mma cut it
[22:32] there and um basically say that that
[22:36] this song was gener to me this is really
[22:39] what gets to what AI music is uh because
[22:42] uh there's a comedian named King wonus
[22:44] who logged into udio one of the tools
[22:45] I'm going to tell you about typed in a
[22:47] prompt I think typed in some lyrics if
[22:49] I'm not mistaken and generated this song
[22:51] he didn't get in his Studio he didn't
[22:53] record his vocals there was no voice
[22:55] conversion he just typed in some words
[22:56] and got this BBL Jersey song
[22:59] um and I I think uh this is like a
[23:02] Monumental moment in music as well
[23:04] because it was one of the first times I
[23:05] saw something like this go viral and I
[23:08] think we'll get into we I mean we can if
[23:10] you guys are interested we can get into
[23:11] like some of the legality of AI
[23:13] generated music and the copyrights
[23:15] around it um but but I think this this
[23:20] moment where he he created this BBL
[23:21] Jersey song and viral it's been used in
[23:23] a bunch of different songs now it's like
[23:25] it's like Monumental but but but this is
[23:27] text to music there was no prior
[23:29] recording he just generated uh this song
[23:31] One One Shot uh prompt to a
[23:35] song I think I might had one more good
[23:38] example
[23:39] for yeah I'll play this for a little
[23:44] bit 11 Labs is another uh AI startup
[23:48] that has now entered the text to music
[23:52] space and this is a song that they
[23:54] generated again no prior recordings this
[23:56] is just text uh music came out the other
[23:59] end and it went viral on
[24:11] Twitter we were having
[24:14] fun programming young dreaming that one
[24:19] day we make it work lines of code we'd
[24:25] ride all night hoping
[24:28] one day we get it
[24:32] right
[24:35] we oh he was about to get into it I I
[24:37] cut off a little too early but but
[24:38] basically this is a sort of meta song
[24:40] because it's an AI model singing about
[24:42] gpus um and I thought that that was
[24:45] pretty cool uh but but yeah another text
[24:47] to music song that I would kind of put
[24:48] into the uh meme the meme song
[24:52] category um with that being said I think
[24:55] I had oh yeah so uh audio to Music These
[24:57] are actually the most interesting
[24:58] samples examples and also uh the
[25:01] shortest if I'm not
[25:03] mistaken
[25:06] um so I'll get into some of these These
[25:08] are really cool I think
[25:10] the the people who are like uh musicians
[25:13] or artists who have a lot of talent
[25:15] already uh like musical Talent already
[25:18] are are into
[25:20] um oh let me play this into this style
[25:24] of uh music generation because it takes
[25:27] an existing sound might notice that I
[25:29] sound like that new Yeezy track goes
[25:31] into another
[25:33] song an existing sound and turned it
[25:35] into music sorry
[25:47] [Music]
[25:58] so uh this is uh using stable audio it's
[26:01] another tool it's Noto or audio but it
[26:03] is called stable audio and I think this
[26:05] was the first tool I saw that had this
[26:08] feature publicly available where you
[26:09] could put audio in and get a a song out
[26:11] or get music out maybe not a full song
[26:14] um but I I really like this because it I
[26:16] think it unlocks a lot of different ways
[26:18] to create music um so I I think that's I
[26:22] might have one more example to show you
[26:25] guys this one was cool this is also from
[26:28] the the suo team as opposed to stable
[26:31] audio this one's pretty
[26:37] [Music]
[26:50] good nice okay um so I thought that was
[26:55] pretty cool because literally all he
[26:56] recorded was his fingers drumming like
[26:57] that on the the desk and then out came
[26:59] this full song with a guitar and all
[27:01] these other instruments um so I think
[27:03] that's you guys kind of get the the gist
[27:05] of like what uh audio uh audio to audio
[27:08] U model generation or music generation
[27:10] can be
[27:11] like um and I want to say with that we
[27:15] can get directly into actually
[27:16] generating some songs ourselves okay we
[27:19] could talk about how it works but uh you
[27:21] guys didn't really seem so much
[27:23] interested in like the technical side
[27:25] when I was looking at the poll so I
[27:28] could briefly touch on it but I think
[27:30] um how by show of hands how many of you
[27:32] guys saw that sunno and udio have been
[27:35] uh are getting sued this week you guys
[27:37] saw that yeah the Raa just filed a
[27:41] complaint against both services so um
[27:44] and and what they're alleging is that
[27:46] these uh AI models are trained on
[27:49] massive music data sets that are
[27:50] copyrighted and we are well not we don't
[27:53] don't put me in no indictments I do not
[27:55] want to
[27:56] be but cuz I that's another thing I I
[27:59] didn't mention at the beginning but I
[28:00] have no affiliation toso udio stable
[28:02] audio Boomie no one like I I I just like
[28:04] this stuff and learned it and uh figured
[28:06] it out and wanted to do a presentation
[28:08] on it um but but what they're alleging
[28:12] is that sunno and udio are infringing on
[28:15] their copyrights by training on this
[28:16] this
[28:22] music yeah yeah yeah we had a a comment
[28:26] from the audience saying that the last
[28:27] uh generation sounded like Tom Petty um
[28:30] if you are more interested in how these
[28:33] models actually work the architecture
[28:34] Transformers versus diffusion uh I have
[28:37] a link on the page that I mentioned
[28:39] earlier if you click on the notes button
[28:41] and then scroll all the way to the
[28:42] bottom I have compiled a list of all of
[28:44] the uh music model papers so if you guys
[28:47] are interested uh some you can find it
[28:51] there um okay so what I want to do now
[28:55] as we get into uh udio andso there is a
[28:59] lot less people than I thought there was
[29:00] going to be so this will work well
[29:02] hopefully but there's a business card on
[29:06] the table in front of you and that
[29:09] business card has a secret code on it
[29:12] this is a little PVP uh survival of the
[29:14] fittest like May May the best man win
[29:17] but if you take that secret code go to
[29:21] the link that I showed earlier let me
[29:22] put on the screen
[29:25] again and click on the Gateway button
[29:28] there should be a green Gateway button
[29:30] that looks like this if you put in that
[29:33] code what will pop up is a username and
[29:37] a
[29:38] password if you use that username and
[29:40] password to sign into any of these
[29:43] Services let me try and make it a little
[29:45] bigger than
[29:48] that if you want to get into udio you
[29:51] can use Google discord Twitter Apple
[29:53] I've signed up for all the services if
[29:55] you want to get into tuno you can do
[29:57] Discord Google or Hotmail Microsoft
[29:59] whatever they're calling it
[30:02] nowadays and then you can sign into so
[30:04] what I did for this presentation so you
[30:06] guys could generate music uh freely
[30:08] because I I know in the the show notes
[30:10] uh for this Workshop I put that you guys
[30:12] should have your own account but I also
[30:14] thought it would be cool if we could do
[30:15] like unlimited Generations as opposed to
[30:16] what they give you on the free uh
[30:18] account so what I did was I signed up
[30:20] and paid for a premier account for udio
[30:22] andso and gave you guys a login just now
[30:24] so if you go log in you can generate
[30:27] music as we're talking about uh the next
[30:29] couple
[30:32] steps just know that uh I like I think
[30:35] TFA is on Apple if I'm not mistaken so
[30:39] there might be some difficulty getting
[30:41] in but just try and get into one of
[30:42] these Services then log into udio Orso
[30:45] and and the the uh URL for that I think
[30:47] I have it here is ud.com once you've
[30:50] signed into to one of the other
[30:52] authorization services or
[30:54] s.com will'll get you into uh one of
[30:57] these one of these
[30:58] sites worked nice awesome we got
[31:01] somebody in oh another person awesome
[31:03] awesome awesome hey PVP some of you guys
[31:06] might not make it I'm G lie to
[31:09] you but yeah I just wanted to do that so
[31:11] you guys had um and actually what I'm
[31:12] going to do as well like when you guys
[31:14] are in your seats generating songs
[31:16] there's another link on this uh uh AI
[31:19] talk.com music page where it says
[31:22] submissions what I want to do uh we
[31:24] might be tied on time but what I want to
[31:27] do is have everyone who generates songs
[31:29] here in person to submit to this link uh
[31:32] it's basically just a Google form so you
[31:34] generate some
[31:35] music take the link the share link to
[31:37] that music on either Service uh click on
[31:40] this link here submissions and submit
[31:42] your song and I think what I'm going to
[31:43] do at the end is just take like a random
[31:45] number generator and uh two people will
[31:48] be selected to get access like keep
[31:51] access to these two accounts that I set
[31:52] up so one of you guys will walk away
[31:54] with like a sunno account one of you
[31:55] guys will walk away with a udio account
[31:59] and I I said I paid for the premier it's
[32:01] I didn't pay for the whole year after
[32:02] they got sued I was like yeah I might
[32:03] not want to
[32:06] invest so I just went ahead and did 30
[32:11] days okay so we can get into some of the
[32:15] techniques while we're on this topic uh
[32:17] and you guys are hopefully generating in
[32:18] your seats as well does anyone here have
[32:20] a birthday this
[32:22] week nice My Man Randy Travis um
[32:28] what's your
[32:29] name Patrick okay I think what we're
[32:31] going to do is generate a a birthday
[32:33] song for
[32:34] Patrick and I'm G do that for my
[32:39] account wait one more
[32:42] time yes
[32:45] absolutely Patrick my
[32:51] man uh Randy Travis oh they're gonna
[32:54] block that fan and uh music
[32:59] I'm not even going to
[33:03] try there you
[33:06] go yeah they just I don't know udio may
[33:09] not be as bad about this but uh if you
[33:12] put artist names and obviously now
[33:14] because they're being sued but if you
[33:16] put artist names they like they have a
[33:18] Content filter you know what I mean they
[33:25] don't absolutely I'm I'm going to talk
[33:28] about that as well like ways to kind of
[33:29] get around the filters um but yeah that
[33:32] definitely works uh we had a comment
[33:33] from the audience that basically said if
[33:36] you like change the spelling up a little
[33:37] bit and then put like the style of music
[33:39] that the artist is related to you can
[33:43] uh you can skape ATT an attorney a
[33:48] attorney put oh [ __ ] oh you're the one
[33:51] suing uh sunno and udia
[34:02] uh birthday time for
[34:04] Patrick let's put in
[34:08] some Patrick what you like what kind of
[34:10] music you
[34:17] like which is what
[34:20] genre
[34:23] Rock one more time rocker Billy I I'm
[34:27] I'm be honest with you I'm
[34:35] lost let's go ahead and generate a song
[34:38] for my boy
[34:40] Patrick and then I'm GNA take the same
[34:44] prompt I'm kind of getting into some of
[34:46] the um prompting techniques here but you
[34:50] guys are able to see the screen I hope
[34:51] and see what I'm
[34:55] doing and then we'll play a song
[34:59] uh couldn't generate that song
[35:00] description named Randy
[35:02] Travis what about Tandy
[35:18] Ravis rabbit who is
[35:20] rabbit listen brother just give me my
[35:22] song
[35:29] all
[35:33] right all right so I'm not monologuing
[35:35] the whole time I'm going go ahead and
[35:36] wrap it up but I the way I think of
[35:38] these two different Services is that uh
[35:39] udio is more like a songwriting partner
[35:43] um they have an experimental model that
[35:45] you guys now have access to if you log
[35:46] into that Premier account that I paid
[35:48] for uh but but the default udio
[35:50] experience is that you generate 30 SEC
[35:52] 30 seconds of Music at a time um and you
[35:54] could either extend that idea remix that
[35:57] idea or there's a third option I didn't
[35:58] write here and you can scrap it because
[35:59] a lot of times you know you get weird
[36:01] stuff uh when when you're not great at
[36:04] prompting um but you can also use
[36:08] inpainting uh to to modify uh specific
[36:12] sections of a song like if you want to
[36:13] change just or tweak one or two little
[36:16] things and then now they have this
[36:17] feature on within UD where you can do
[36:20] the audio to audio and it it allows you
[36:22] to upload music um so I I if you are an
[36:26] artist and you write songs or I've
[36:28] written a song before or spoken word or
[36:31] anything I would urge you to try to take
[36:34] one of your creation especially if
[36:36] you've recorded it it gets crazy if
[36:38] you've recorded some music before you
[36:40] should take the
[36:42] tempo uh the key that that song is in
[36:45] and your lyrics and put it into udio and
[36:48] see what comes out the other end it's
[36:49] blown my mind a couple times I've taken
[36:50] a couple of my own songs and putting
[36:52] them in and it man it gets crazy what
[36:54] what comes out the other side like udio
[36:56] does me better than I do me sometimes
[36:59] honestly so so it's a really cool
[37:00] experience if you have like pre-existing
[37:02] music you can uh really play with udio a
[37:05] lot and then the way that I think about
[37:06] sunno um is your in-house music
[37:11] producer uh I like to describe it in a
[37:13] way that I I feel
[37:16] like somewhere in the system prompt of
[37:18] Sun's model they have like top 40 music
[37:21] in there because it always comes out
[37:22] really polished and clean and maybe it's
[37:24] the way that the data that they put into
[37:25] the M into the model in the first place
[37:27] but but my experience with suo has that
[37:29] been been that uh just comes out really
[37:31] really clean um top 40ish one thing
[37:34] that's gotten really really good at
[37:35] lately there's like a a a side note is
[37:39] that when I first I I personally have
[37:42] onboarded like I think a dozen or so
[37:44] people over the last couple weeks
[37:45] because I wanted to um understand what
[37:48] is the actual use case uh for these
[37:50] services so I just started onboarding
[37:52] friends and family some of my music
[37:54] friends some people that are not into
[37:55] music at all and what I found when uh a
[37:57] couple weeks ago was that like when I
[37:59] would generate songs uh if you're not
[38:01] super specific and Counting the
[38:04] syllables in each line of the song when
[38:06] you're getting into the custom mode ofso
[38:08] it'll the timing of the beat and the
[38:12] artist quote unquote the vocals lyrics
[38:15] gets super off really really really off
[38:18] um but they've gotten really good about
[38:19] this lately like the last couple songs
[38:21] I've generated from suo aren't off um
[38:24] they've the song structure is a lot
[38:26] better cuz that's another tip we'll get
[38:27] into that the song structure really
[38:30] um has improved a lot U um Ino over the
[38:33] last couple weeks but but it's more or
[38:36] less the same just the outputs are a
[38:37] little bit different from uh udio and
[38:40] now we get into the
[38:43] tutorial um so have you guys anyone
[38:45] submitted any songs
[38:47] yet let me see let me
[38:51] recheck I was just uh generating some
[38:53] music for my boy Patrick We're going to
[38:55] play that in a second but that was that
[38:56] was the basic tutorial you kind of it's
[38:58] about as simple as it gets like it
[38:59] really really lowers the barrier to
[39:01] entry for creating music and I think we
[39:04] we can get into some some other stuff
[39:06] about like more conversations about that
[39:07] but I think it for now I'll just say
[39:08] that it it lowers the the barrier and
[39:11] makes it easier to uh create stuff for
[39:15] you know specific situations okay nice
[39:17] we have a couple submissions we do have
[39:18] a couple submissions but the gist of it
[39:20] is you go to audio.com you log
[39:23] in you go to this uh oh they to have oh
[39:27] I guess here at the top it it always
[39:29] says create then you can type
[39:32] in uh what's another one the AI
[39:37] engineer World's
[39:39] Fair let me start over a song about the
[39:43] AI engineer Worlds
[39:48] Fair and I know uh the organizer
[39:51] Benjamin Dy dumpy really likes old
[39:53] school hip hop
[39:58] boom B so I'll generate a song so you
[40:01] come in you type in your prompt you hit
[40:03] create uh there's a couple of different
[40:05] options down here again if you have a
[40:06] free account you won't see this
[40:08] experimental longer song um uh you
[40:11] you'll be defaulted to the udio 32 model
[40:14] but you can come in and write your own
[40:15] lyrics on top of this prompt that you
[40:17] just put
[40:18] in or or you can select to only have an
[40:21] instrumental generated as opposed to uh
[40:23] a full song with lyrics and everything
[40:25] um so add add core that's how it works
[40:28] for pretty much all these Services as
[40:29] well there's not too much beyond that
[40:30] that you need to know to start
[40:32] generating music I would argue that
[40:34] there's a lot more that you need to know
[40:35] if you want to get good at it but that's
[40:36] that's pretty much uh how we um generate
[40:39] music on both
[40:41] services and what I like to do just to
[40:43] get a nice even comparison is use the
[40:45] same exact prompt I'll refresh the page
[40:48] cuz like for some reason they're really
[40:49] buggy uh sometimes where if you generate
[40:52] song after song without refreshing the
[40:54] page you get like extensions of songs as
[40:56] opposed to a brand new song
[40:59] but I will go ahead and create based on
[41:02] this
[41:05] prompt and then I'mma come back because
[41:08] we've now gone over the basic tutorial
[41:09] I'mma come back and look at some
[41:10] questions because I know some questions
[41:11] came in
[41:14] nice and in the meantime while I'm
[41:16] getting my thoughts together I'm going
[41:17] to uh play my song or the song that that
[41:20] was created for Patrick wishing them a
[41:22] happy birthday oh moderation
[41:25] area they didn't like your um um my my
[41:28] Randy
[41:30] Travis let's go ahead and play this one
[41:33] for a little
[41:35] [Music]
[41:39] bit it's your day Patrick we're singing
[41:42] loud for you oh yes oh yes it's true
[41:46] it's your time Patrick celebrate the
[41:48] whole day through oh yeah oh yeah you
[41:54] know woo
[41:58] [Applause]
[42:03] [Music]
[42:08] [Applause]
[42:13] happy
[42:15] birthday
[42:18] yeah oh we know Patrick you love that
[42:21] rock and roll oh yeah yeah oh yeah and
[42:25] country hits feel it in your soul oh
[42:29] yeah oh
[42:31] yes Patrick what you
[42:34] [Laughter]
[42:39] think Patrick said it's the the theme
[42:41] song for his sitcom I'm G play these
[42:43] other two quick I just want to hear what
[42:44] they sound
[42:46] [Music]
[42:51] like uh real quick if you click on the
[42:53] actual song name you can see the lyrics
[42:55] on the sunno side
[42:57] [Music]
[43:01] birthday candles flame so
[43:05] bright for a coniss of music
[43:11] life rocking through the day and night
[43:16] night Patrick's world is pure
[43:20] [Music]
[43:23] delight I'm going to try the other
[43:25] version see if uh was that more your
[43:27] speed
[43:28] Patrick oh awesome okay all
[43:31] right oh we got five minutes left
[43:33] [Music]
[43:41] on
[43:43] birthday okay so either they generated
[43:46] the same song twice
[43:50] or yeah
[43:53] maybe yeah let's see with the AI
[43:55] engineer World Fair song and actually
[43:57] let's address these questions because we
[43:58] only have a couple minutes
[44:01] left and then I'll get into the notes
[44:04] real quick cuz uh I did want to show you
[44:05] guys some of the prompt stuff the truth
[44:07] is that like I have everything in um
[44:09] under the notes section like pretty much
[44:10] everything I talked about today also
[44:12] when the recording becomes available you
[44:13] can come back to the same page get
[44:15] access to the recording and then I'll
[44:17] hopefully have the transcript up in like
[44:19] an hour um because I recorded it
[44:22] myself but if you come here to this page
[44:25] AI talk.com music and click on the notes
[44:28] section um and you want to not listen to
[44:31] me talk about the prompts you can find
[44:33] the prompt stuff yourself uh not quite
[44:35] all the way at the bottom but here uh
[44:38] close to the bottom and uh this is a GPT
[44:41] prompt meaning you literally can go to
[44:42] chat GPT use this prompt it got a little
[44:45] bit weird like for some reason when I
[44:46] use these closing brackets in GitHub um
[44:49] it like basically disappears the whole
[44:52] and like you won't even see lyrics
[44:53] anymore but basically what you can do is
[44:55] I I think even this would work like gbt
[44:56] 4 is is now smart enough to do this you
[44:58] can take and you can put in this uh
[45:00] template and then actually fill in the
[45:02] top here where it says song description
[45:03] and GPT will actually produce some
[45:05] coherent lyrics and it allows for better
[45:07] music generation when you uh come in
[45:09] with the lyrics as opposed to giving it
[45:10] a general topic and hoping it comes up
[45:12] with good lyrics itself you can kind of
[45:14] tweak the lyrics yourself before you
[45:16] start to generate so that's the GPT
[45:17] prompt and then for the music model
[45:19] prompts uh these are pretty much just
[45:21] examples of what we uh just did with uh
[45:23] Patrick and um the AI engineer World's
[45:26] Fair song it's just like a general
[45:27] description of a song um that you want
[45:30] to hear that you want to generate and
[45:32] then it pops out the other
[45:34] end
[45:36] uh super pressed for time um there are
[45:40] some official udio andso
[45:42] tips um that are very useful as well and
[45:48] then here I I kind of want to get into
[45:49] the prompt Master thing
[45:52] actually Phillip asked is there a way to
[45:56] trans to do voice transfer of a more
[45:59] generic voice rather than a specific
[46:00] voice referring to the voice conversion
[46:03] stuff that we talked about earlier and I
[46:05] think the end of that question got cut
[46:07] off because you said
[46:15] like are you talking about doing voice
[46:17] conversion training like training models
[46:19] yourself like going to one of the
[46:21] services or downloading the tools you
[46:22] literally can just take and blend
[46:24] multiple voices so the way that it works
[46:26] is like you need depending on what
[46:28] service or model you're us or what uh um
[46:30] training tool set you're using you need
[46:32] like minimum 6 seconds of someone's
[46:35] voice to start training um and and you
[46:37] get like a kind of coherent model after
[46:39] that but what you can essentially do is
[46:40] just 6 seconds of your voice 6 seconds
[46:43] of his voice 6 seconds of Eminem and
[46:45] kind of like Blends it together or you
[46:46] can just go to a TTS service and get
[46:48] like an actual like robot voice like
[46:50] someone a voice that doesn't belong to a
[46:52] real person and then use that to train
[46:54] on so yeah for copyright purposes yeah
[46:55] you can you can do that
[46:59] dang they got to wrap it up okay um what
[47:02] recommendations do you have to help
[47:03] advocate for the responsible and ethical
[47:05] use
[47:08] of yeah sorry about that I don't know
[47:10] why the questions are getting cut
[47:14] off oh ethical use of AI music
[47:21] um that's a good one I'mma Be Honest
[47:24] I'mma plead the fifth because I'm not a
[47:25] lawyer
[47:27] I I'll be completely honest I'll be
[47:29] completely
[47:31] honest oh yeah yeah good point um what
[47:36] tool generates the best cloned voice
[47:38] that can match emotional tone like
[47:39] Kendrick Lamar's Euphoria three
[47:42] switches the best clone voice I would
[47:44] definitely look into RVC if you can you
[47:45] can use RVC in the cloud you don't have
[47:47] to like when you Google RVC there comes
[47:49] up a bunch of tutorials on how to run it
[47:50] yourself locally you do not have to do
[47:52] that you can run it in the cloud cuz you
[47:54] need um some decent Hardware to like
[47:56] computer hardware to do it but but
[47:58] definitely look into RVC it's the best
[48:00] right now can we have access to the
[48:02] slides yeah and my time is up shortly oh
[48:06] oh my did my thing go to sleep it did go
[48:08] to
[48:14] sleep oh to log into udio
[48:19] Orso
[48:21] really
[48:25] uh oh okay okay sorry sorry that's my
[48:30] blender um that was pretty much it oh
[48:33] rate rate your music is something you
[48:34] definitely should check out like what
[48:35] someone basically reverse engineered is
[48:37] that these models were trained on labels
[48:41] from rate your music so you can almost
[48:42] reverse engineer exactly what sound you
[48:45] want by going to rate your music typing
[48:47] in an artist name typing in a genre um
[48:51] or really just typing in what you want
[48:53] to hear and then using whatever labels
[48:55] they put on that music you put it back
[48:57] into the model itself soon soono or
[48:58] audio stable audio sometimes I think um
[49:01] and you can get like very very close to
[49:03] a specific uh sound I don't want to say
[49:06] specific artist but like yeah you can
[49:07] get pretty close
[49:09] um yes and I I was going to get into
[49:13] like the law thing I don't you you want
[49:15] me to differentiate between ethics and
[49:17] law and I understand but I was going to
[49:18] get into a little bit but we we kind of
[49:19] ran out of time so I apologize for that
[49:21] if you guys would like I love to talk
[49:23] about this stuff all day if you if you
[49:24] want to approach me after the workshop
[49:26] and we chop it up all day about this
[49:27] stuff I love it um yeah and and then
[49:31] what I'll do for giving away the
[49:33] accounts maybe I'll do like a live
[49:35] stream or something like that and do
[49:36] like a grab everybody's email who
[49:38] submitted because I think we had nice we
[49:40] had 12 submissions Let me refresh I
[49:43] think we had 12 submissions and I'll
[49:44] pick somebody and just like send you
[49:46] guys I'll change the username and
[49:47] password so everybody can't log into
[49:49] your stuff and then I'll give you uh
[49:51] I'll give you the accounts but yeah I I
[49:53] appreciate you guys for coming uh hope
[49:54] you guys got something out of this and
[49:55] walked away with some music generated
[49:57] some stuff and I think I'll play a song
[50:00] to go
[50:02] [Music]
[50:04] out through the fair coer wires in the
[50:09] airers in the Screen Dreams turning in
[50:12] the scenes blueprints in my hand robots
[50:17] take a
[50:20] stand
[50:22] sh the gift he I dreams
[50:29] [Music]
[50:31] dang that's dope I wonder what udio
[50:36] generated oh oh first because I just saw
[50:38] the question that someone said uh stems
[50:40] how to like pull the stems out and like
[50:42] edit them there's a tool again not not
[50:45] um like I have no affiliation with them
[50:47] but if you just go to actually the easi
[50:49] way to do this is let's say we just take
[50:51] this uh Happy Birthday Song by Patrick
[50:54] we go too.com all you have to do is uh
[50:58] sun.com
[50:59] orod do.com like literally go to the
[51:02] link where you just generated the song
[51:04] type in da aw digital audio workstation
[51:07] at the end of the uh URL not the end of
[51:09] the URL but the end of the the domain
[51:11] name and hit enter and I think it takes
[51:15] anywhere from 30 seconds to let's go
[51:19] ahead and sign in real
[51:20] quick to 90 seconds I've had to wait
[51:23] longer for some of the songs because
[51:24] it's more complicated to do sorry guys I
[51:27] forgot to mention this but yeah like if
[51:29] you go and do that type in Daw at the
[51:32] end of the uhso song it'll pull that
[51:35] that exact song that you just generated
[51:36] into this digital audio workstation and
[51:38] give you stem by STEM and then let you
[51:40] control the volume of each each specific
[51:42] stem and by STEM I just mean each
[51:44] specific instrument they do all the
[51:46] different instruments and then the vocal
[51:48] itself so this is a really really cool
[51:49] tool that I think is like a startup that
[51:52] hasn't been around for that long um but
[51:55] it's it's a really really cool tool for
[51:57] like uh being able to to to get more
[52:00] control out of your
[52:02] Generations so I just wanted
[52:05] to d da so digital audio
[52:09] workstation and you can
[52:12] [Music]
[52:14] like let's say I don't like the vocals
[52:17] but I really like the
[52:18] [Music]
[52:24] music rock
[52:30] [Music]
[52:44] world and this is just
[52:51] vocal it's the base
[52:57] in
[52:57] [Music]
[53:01] his hat that's
[53:07] through happy
[53:14] birthday let the
[53:18] mus
[53:21] [Music]
[53:25] you so yeah that's uh pretty much how
[53:27] you use Wave It's called wave tool that
[53:29] uh that service so that's how you can
[53:31] get the stems there's also another tool
[53:33] called uvr5 but it gets really involved
[53:36] you do have to have like de decent
[53:38] Hardware but you can also use like uh
[53:40] instead of using like an online service
[53:42] where I think all the accounts on Wave
[53:43] tool right now are free but you can use
[53:45] uvr5 locally forever it's like an open
[53:48] source software project that uh allows
[53:50] you to pull stems just like this
[53:51] literally you can get and that that's
[53:53] not just a AI generated music any song
[53:56] you can put into uvr5 and get like the
[53:58] stems from it's actually pretty cool I
[54:00] know yeah appreciate
[54:03] it I know they want you guys to go over
[54:06] to the uh what was it called again
[54:08] session yeah the General Session so I'm
[54:11] I'mma shut the hell up now I appreciate
[54:13] you guys thank you thank you for coming
[54:18] [Music]
