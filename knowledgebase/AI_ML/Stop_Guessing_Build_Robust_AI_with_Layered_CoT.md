## Actionable Takeaways  
1. **Implement Layered CoT**: Add verification steps after each reasoning stage to catch errors early.  
2. **Leverage Multi-agentic Systems**: Use specialized agents to distribute tasks and improve system resilience.  
3. **Prioritize Transparency**: Design AI systems for auditability and interpretability.  
4. **Validate Inferences**: Ensure each step in the reasoning chain is cross-checked against reliable data sources.

[00:00] true AI isn't about one giant leap of
[00:03] faith it's built incrementally with
[00:06] every step verified and refined through
[00:08] collaborative
[00:09] effort hi I'm Manish sanwal director of
[00:12] AI at newscorp my work focuses on AI
[00:15] reasoning explainability and automation
[00:18] today I'm excited to show you how we can
[00:20] build AI that just isn't smarter but
[00:24] also more structured and self-correcting
[00:27] using layer Chain of Thought with multi
[00:29] multi- agentic
[00:32] systems let's start with the basics what
[00:35] are multi- agentic systems and simple
[00:37] terms they are collection of specialized
[00:39] AI agents that work together to tackle a
[00:42] complex task each agent is designed to
[00:45] handle a specific part of the overall
[00:47] problem rather than relying on massive
[00:50] monolith
[00:52] systems take self-driving cars for
[00:54] example instead of depending on a
[00:57] massive system picture it as a team of
[01:00] specialized agents one detects
[01:03] pedestrian other reads traffic signal
[01:05] maybe a third one which checks for the
[01:07] best route with each agent doing its
[01:11] part in harmony the entire system
[01:13] becomes much more robust and efficient
[01:16] the modular approach offers several
[01:18] concrete advantages
[01:21] specialization uh each agent can be
[01:23] finely tuned for a specific task leading
[01:26] to a better accurate accuracy and
[01:28] performance
[01:32] since the system is distributed
[01:34] individual agents can be updated or
[01:37] improved without overhauling the entire
[01:39] system so the system becomes flexible
[01:42] and
[01:43] scalable if one agent encounters an
[01:46] issue the other can often compensate
[01:48] ensuring that overall system remains
[01:51] reliable and fall
[01:53] tolerant by integrating these
[01:56] well-coordinated agents we create a
[01:58] system that is inherently more robust
[02:01] and effective and when we add Chain of
[02:04] Thought reasoning into the mix each
[02:06] agent not only performs its task but
[02:09] also explains its decision-making
[02:11] process step by step this com this
[02:14] combination enhances both transparency
[02:17] and resiliency in our AI
[02:21] system so what is Chain of Thought Chain
[02:24] of Thought is a method that guides AI to
[02:27] Think Through the problem step by step
[02:30] rather than simply guessing the answers
[02:33] traditionally when we work with large
[02:35] language models we provide them with the
[02:38] detailed prompt and ask for a final
[02:40] answer even if we Supply extensive
[02:43] context the model often jumps directly
[02:46] to a conclusion without revealing how it
[02:49] arrived there almost as if it's just
[02:53] guessing now imagine if instead of
[02:56] demanding the answer outright we ask the
[02:59] model to walk us through its reasoning
[03:02] process outlining every step along the
[03:05] way this is the essence of Chain of
[03:07] Thought prompting by breaking down a
[03:10] complex problem into a series of
[03:13] manageable step the model not only
[03:16] demonstrate how it processes the
[03:18] information but also exposes the path it
[03:21] takes to reach the
[03:23] conclusion it this approach has two key
[03:27] benefits transparency for one we get to
[03:30] see each stage of reasoning process
[03:33] which helps us understand how the model
[03:34] is tracking the
[03:37] problem second opportunity for
[03:40] fine-tuning and debugging if we spot a
[03:43] mistake in any of the intermediate steps
[03:46] we can adjust the prompt or the process
[03:49] allowing us to correct errors before the
[03:51] final answer answer is provided so in
[03:54] short Chain of Thought transforms the
[03:57] ai's internal reacing into viable and
[04:00] verifiable sequence making the entire
[04:03] process more interpretable and R in
[04:07] summary instead of Simply guessing the
[04:10] AI follows clear logical sequence of
[04:13] steps this approach Chain of Thought
[04:16] makes the AI reasoning process
[04:18] transparent but it comes with several
[04:23] limitations the process is highly
[04:25] sensitive to how the prompts are phrased
[04:28] even a slight change in wording or
[04:30] context can lead to a very different
[04:33] output this means that two almost
[04:36] identical prompts might yield vastly
[04:39] different Chain of Thought complicating
[04:41] both reproducibility and
[04:44] reliability as the AI generates its
[04:47] reasoning step by step there is no
[04:49] builted mechanism to verify or correct
[04:52] mistakes during the process this absence
[04:55] of realtime feedback means that there is
[04:58] no error correction opportunity
[05:02] each step in the chain is produced
[05:04] without continuous validation if an
[05:07] early inference was flawed this can
[05:09] cause a Cascade of errors that
[05:12] compromises the Integrity of the entire
[05:14] process without ongoing checks the model
[05:17] is forced to rely on initial assumptions
[05:20] and the only opportunity to correct is
[05:23] correct it is after the inference is
[05:28] complete when phase with problem that
[05:30] involves multiple interdependent factors
[05:34] Chain of Thought can sometime Miss
[05:36] critical connection the model might not
[05:39] fully integrate all the possible
[05:41] variables into its reasoning resulting
[05:44] in oversimplified or incomplete
[05:47] conclusion in a sense while Chain of
[05:50] Thought provides a transparent
[05:51] step-by-step framework for AI reasoning
[05:54] it's sensitive to prompt design lack of
[05:57] real-time feedback loop and un verified
[06:00] reasoning these are some of the
[06:02] challenges that we try to address it
[06:06] brings us to layer Chain of Thought
[06:08] prompting what I like to call layered
[06:10] coot for short this approach is designed
[06:13] to overcome the limitation of standard
[06:16] Chain of Thought methods by integrating
[06:18] a verification Step at every stage of
[06:21] the reasoning process it works in Two
[06:23] Steps step one generation of initial
[06:26] thought the AI agent Begins by producing
[06:29] an initial thought this is the first
[06:32] piece of reasoning generated from the
[06:34] input prompts at this stage the model
[06:38] formulates an early hypothesis of the
[06:40] problem and it serves as the starting
[06:43] point for the further
[06:45] reasoning step two verification against
[06:48] the knowledge base before moving on the
[06:50] generated thought is immediately
[06:53] verified this involves cross referencing
[06:55] the output against a structured
[06:58] knowledge base or an external database
[07:00] in practice this might include a fact
[07:02] checking algorithm a consistency check
[07:05] through contextual reasoning or maybe a
[07:09] model an emble model to check for the
[07:13] accuracy but this verification step is
[07:16] really crucial it ensures that only
[07:19] accurate and reliable information is
[07:21] allowed to influence subsequent
[07:24] reasoning once the thought is verified
[07:27] the process continues to the next
[07:28] reasoning step
[07:30] this iterative process repeats
[07:33] repeatedly generates a new thought
[07:35] verifies it and then process it the
[07:39] chain of reasoning is thus built up step
[07:41] by step with each link in the chain
[07:44] confirmed before the next
[07:46] Ed the benefit of this additional
[07:49] verification step are
[07:51] significant self correction for one the
[07:54] verification at each step allows the
[07:57] system to catch and correct errors early
[08:01] preventing mistakes from propagating
[08:03] through the entire reasoning
[08:05] chain second dness against prompt
[08:08] variability because each step is
[08:11] independently verified the overall
[08:14] process becomes less sensitive to small
[08:16] changes in the input leading to high
[08:20] reproducibility each verified step
[08:23] ensures that the final output is built
[08:26] on the foundation of accurate and
[08:28] validated information
[08:30] resulting in more trustworthy
[08:33] conclusions breaking down the reasoning
[08:35] into discrete verifiable step makes the
[08:38] AI thought process much more transparent
[08:41] allowing for easier auditing and
[08:45] interpretation in essence layer CH Chain
[08:48] of Thought transforms the AI reasoning
[08:51] into robust iterative Frameworks where
[08:55] every step is checked for accuracy this
[08:58] not only mitigates the inherent
[09:00] weaknesses of traditional Chain of
[09:01] Thought but also leads to more reliable
[09:05] reproducible and interpretable AI
[09:09] models in summary layer Chain of Thought
[09:13] prompting overcomes the limitation of
[09:14] layer traditional coot by adding
[09:16] verification step after each thought it
[09:19] generates this method can be seamlessly
[09:22] implemented using existing llm tools and
[09:25] integrates perfectly within the multi-
[09:27] agentic systems
[09:29] where each specialized agent contribute
[09:31] to a robust robust
[09:34] system overall layered coot enhances
[09:37] both accuracy and reproducibility by
[09:40] ensuring every inference is validated
[09:43] before proceeding remember the future of
[09:46] AI isn't just about building bigger
[09:49] models but it's about creating system
[09:51] that are structured explainable and
[09:54] reliable by prioritizing transparency
[09:57] self corre self-corrections
[09:59] collaboration and validation We Lay the
[10:01] foundation for the true truly
[10:03] trustworthy AI we have a paper published
[10:05] on layer trade of thought prompting the
