# Summary of "Building AI Teams: Insights from SignalFire's Data" by Heath Black

## Overview
Heath Black, a leader at SignalFire, discusses strategies for building AI teams using data-driven insights from SignalFire's internal tool, **Beacon**. The talk emphasizes shifting from traditional academic credentials to evaluating work experience, location trends, and market dynamics in AI hiring.

---

## Key Takeaways

### 1. **Shift in Recruitment Filters**
- **From Credentials to Experience**: 
  - Traditional metrics like PhDs and top-tier school affiliations are losing relevance. 
  - **50% decline** in PhD hires and top school graduates in AI startups over the past decade.
  - Prioritize **work experience** (e.g., open-source contributions, real-world projects) over formal education.
- **Job Postings**: 
  - Remove or soften academic requirements to broaden the talent pool.
  - Ask: *"Do I need a PhD researcher, or can an experienced engineer suffice?"*

### 2. **Location Trends**
- **San Francisco (SF)** remains the AI hub:
  - 35% of AI engineers are based in SF (vs. 29% of all startup engineers).
  - SF accounts for **38% of early-stage AI funding** in the U.S. (26% of total U.S. early-stage funding).
- **Rising Markets**:
  - **New York** and **Seattle** have doubled their AI engineer market share since 2013.
  - These cities "punch above their weight" in AI talent, despite smaller overall tech workforces.

### 3. **Market Dynamics**
- **Talent Movement**:
  - AI talent is concentrating in **"AI League" companies** (e.g., OpenAI, DeepMind, Cohere).
  - **Net movement** of talent is critical: e.g., OpenAI gains talent from DeepMind, while Cohere loses it.
  - Companies on the "left" (traditional tech giants) now compete fiercely for talent from the "right" (emerging AI leaders).

---

## Key Quotes/Insights
- *"Work experience now far surpasses education as the main factor in hiring."*
- *"The market is constantly moving—assess where it’s shifting, not just where it is."*
- *"San Francisco is not dead; it’s still the AI epicenter, but New York and Seattle are rising."*

---

## Actionable Recommendations
1. **Evaluate Work Experience Over Credentials**: 
   - Prioritize open-source projects, portfolios, and real-world impact.
2. **Rethink Job Postings**: 
   - Soften or remove academic requirements to attract diverse, experienced candidates.
3. **Target Talent Hotspots**: 
   - Focus on **SF, NYC, and Seattle** for AI hiring, but monitor emerging markets.
4. **Track Talent Flows**: 
   - Use data to identify where talent is moving (e.g., OpenAI to Cohere) and adjust hiring strategies accordingly.

[00:17] hi everyone I'm Heath black I'm the
[00:19] managing director of product at signal
[00:22] fire and let's actually take a quick
[00:24] step back and ask uh why am I here uh so
[00:29] before I got involved in Tech I actually
[00:32] went and got a master's in Irish
[00:35] literature of all things uh both of my
[00:37] sons are named after Irish writers and
[00:42] uh you're going to see how this actually
[00:43] weaves into the presentation a little
[00:45] bit later when you get a degree like
[00:47] Irish literature you have to get
[00:49] creative in how you actually use it in
[00:53] 2009 I got involved in uh some startups
[00:57] and I helped ship the first ever
[01:01] conversational chatbot at a company
[01:04] called
[01:04] chirpify uh I then went and worked at a
[01:07] company called imz where we were trying
[01:09] to build a Reddit competitor but a lot
[01:12] nicer and then I actually went and
[01:14] joined Reddit where I worked on
[01:16] experimental business lines and trust
[01:19] and safety
[01:20] tools and I followed that experience up
[01:23] by going to meta where I shipped meta's
[01:26] first assistant it was called M it lived
[01:28] within messenger and then I was the uh
[01:32] first product manager on the AI
[01:34] assistant for their Ray bang glasses but
[01:37] now I serve as a managing director of
[01:39] product at signal fire so what does
[01:43] signal fire do I like to say the signal
[01:46] fire is actually the first VC built like
[01:48] a tech company and what I mean by that
[01:50] is the same way that you all go out and
[01:52] interview customers to figure out
[01:54] whether you're building the right thing
[01:56] for them before you ship your product
[01:58] signal fire interview 500 Founders to
[02:02] understand the things that keep them up
[02:04] at night and make them bang their head
[02:05] against the wall all day we then built
[02:08] AI ml tools and our portfolio success
[02:12] teams entirely around those problems
[02:16] going to Market recruiting building your
[02:19] leadership skills and the ability to
[02:21] launch your product but today we're
[02:24] actually here to talk about uh some
[02:27] things that we've learned from our
[02:29] proprietary a IML platform beacon beacon
[02:33] tracks over 650 million employees 20 or
[02:38] 80 million companies and 200 million
[02:41] open- Source
[02:42] projects and with all of that
[02:44] information we build a variety of
[02:47] proprietary ranking systems and Market
[02:50] insights that we can then use to power
[02:53] our firm so that we can move at startup
[02:56] speed but then also to support the
[02:58] companies that we invest in
[03:02] today's Focus we're going to be using
[03:04] some of the data from Beacon to figure
[03:06] out how to filter the right
[03:09] people to find them in the right
[03:12] locations to nail the right timing and
[03:15] then finally to close them with the
[03:17] right narrative so let's first start
[03:19] with
[03:20] filters when I think about recruiting I
[03:23] think about it in terms of like what
[03:24] filters would I apply to the people that
[03:27] are on my team and that I want on my
[03:29] team
[03:30] Beacon gives people the tools to apply
[03:32] these filters as they search but the
[03:35] reality is if you don't know what
[03:37] filters you need to apply you're not
[03:39] going to find the right people so here's
[03:41] some interesting trends that we've seen
[03:43] that change how we
[03:45] filter over the past you know decade or
[03:49] so we've seen a Stark deenal isation in
[03:53] ai ai startups are hiring more Engineers
[03:56] without phds or prestigious schooling
[03:59] than ever before in 2015
[04:03] 27% of engineer hires were from top
[04:06] schools and 16% had
[04:09] phds in 2023 those numbers were 15% and
[04:13] 7% this is about a 50% decline for both
[04:16] of these numbers over that period of
[04:20] time and you're probably saying that
[04:22] doesn't sound right what about for
[04:24] things like research scientists they've
[04:26] got to have phds right and you know
[04:29] you're not entirely wrong about 40% of
[04:33] research scientists have advanced
[04:35] degrees now this is not PhD is simply
[04:38] Advanced degrees and even still it makes
[04:41] up less than half of the people that
[04:43] serve in research scientist roles
[04:46] today from my standpoint this isn't too
[04:49] surprising because there's been a slight
[04:51] shift in the market since 2015 in 2015
[04:55] we were really focused on the the kind
[04:57] of ml research side of things the
[04:59] foundational side of things whereas
[05:01] today a lot of the work is about
[05:05] applying that to the real world usage of
[05:08] that model it's ml Ops Pro like product
[05:14] like software experience is
[05:16] understanding how users interact with
[05:19] the thing that you're
[05:20] building and with the shift from
[05:22] credentials we've also seen this really
[05:24] interesting people Mobility over this
[05:27] period of time if you look on the left
[05:30] side here historically a lot of the AI
[05:33] Talent was centered on these companies
[05:35] the Googles the Ubers the the metas the
[05:39] apples and over this period of time
[05:41] they've shifted to nine companies that
[05:43] we call the aiv league the companies on
[05:46] the right here have seen a massive
[05:49] concentration of talent over this period
[05:51] of time it's really interesting because
[05:54] we generated this last year shortly
[05:56] after that inflection was acquired so
[06:00] one of the key things that I want us to
[06:01] take away from here is that the market
[06:03] is constantly moving so we have to
[06:06] constantly be assessing where that
[06:09] market is Shifting and the interesting
[06:12] thing as well is that all the companies
[06:14] on the left side of the screen are now
[06:15] fighting viciously to get people from
[06:19] the right side of the screen rather than
[06:21] the other way
[06:23] around but one of the key things is not
[06:25] just knowing where people are going it's
[06:28] about where they're coming from
[06:30] this graph shows you net employee
[06:34] movement between different aiv League
[06:37] companies so to speak as you can see at
[06:39] the top open AI has a positive flow of
[06:42] people from Deep Mind whereas cohere
[06:45] actually has a a negative Trend knowing
[06:50] where people come from and where they're
[06:52] going is essential in ensuring that you
[06:55] are filtering for the right people as
[06:57] you look for PE like you know building
[06:59] out your
[07:01] teams so the takeaway here is that work
[07:04] experience has always been important but
[07:06] it now far surpasses education in terms
[07:09] of the main aspect that you should be
[07:11] looking at here don't just rely on the
[07:14] credentials that someone has you should
[07:17] instead look at the body of work that
[07:18] they've compiled for new workers you can
[07:22] still look at their body of work what
[07:24] are their open source contributions what
[07:26] have they built outside of class the
[07:28] reality is exper experience and what
[07:30] you're building matters more than where
[07:33] you get a degree secondly you should be
[07:36] asking yourself do I need a PhD
[07:38] researcher for the role that I'm hiring
[07:41] or will a really awesome engineer with
[07:44] experience
[07:46] suffice and then the third is that you
[07:48] should actually consider removing
[07:51] academic requirements from your job
[07:53] postings or maybe making them soft so to
[07:57] speak because this will ensure that your
[07:59] top of funnel is getting the people that
[08:01] have the experience you need more so
[08:04] than the
[08:06] education now let's talk about the next
[08:08] aspect which is location I'm sure many
[08:10] of you have seen the debates on Twitter
[08:12] that San Francisco is clearly dead and
[08:16] so we wanted to know is
[08:19] it interestingly the answer is no it's
[08:23] not dead San Francisco makes up about
[08:26] 29% of all startup engineers now this is
[08:30] slightly down from highs of 2013 when it
[08:33] was at 33% but it's up ticking again
[08:35] since
[08:36] 2021 New York and Seattle have also been
[08:39] pretty impressive as they've both
[08:41] doubled the market share of Engineers
[08:44] that they have over that period of time
[08:46] if we were to zoom out and look at big
[08:49] Tech 50% of big Tech Engineers still
[08:54] reside in the San Francisco Bay area but
[08:57] what about AI specifically
[09:00] well San Francisco is still leading the
[09:03] pack 20 or 35% of all engineers in AI
[09:08] reside within San Francisco Seattle
[09:11] makes up about 22% New York makes up
[09:14] about 10% so San Francisco makes up more
[09:16] than both of those cities combined but
[09:18] if you actually look at this slide and
[09:20] compare it with the data that I showed
[09:21] in the previous slide you'll see
[09:24] that these these markets are all
[09:28] punching well above their weight in
[09:31] terms of AI hiring and AI Talent where
[09:35] they had a smaller number in the
[09:36] previous slide they have a much larger
[09:38] number in this one so the talent is
[09:41] concentrating in these threey key
[09:43] markets today now this isn't terribly
[09:46] surprising for me because San Francisco
[09:48] makes up nearly 38% of all early stage
[09:52] funding into AI startups and the
[09:55] interesting thing about this is that San
[09:58] Francisco only has 26% of all early
[10:00] stage funding in the United States total
[10:03] so not only is San Francisco punching
[10:05] above its weight in terms of AI Talent
[10:07] is punching above his way in terms of
[10:09] the funding that is going to AI
[10:11] companies
[10:13] today so the takeaway here is that
[10:15] Twitter doesn't determine whether a
[10:18] market is dead data does location still
[10:22] matters even in a highly distributed
[10:24] world that we live in today San
[10:27] Francisco Seattle and New York are the
[10:29] premier locations for AI Talent today
[10:33] and so your job is to watch the location
[10:36] and funding markets to see where talent
[10:38] and capital is Flowing as another way to
[10:41] filter and find the right
[10:43] people now let's talk about timing
[10:46] finding the right person has as much to
[10:48] do with time as it does
[10:50] Talent at the airport on the way here it
[10:53] was a mere matter of minutes that
[10:55] separated me catching my flight or
[10:57] sitting in the lobby sadly like Charlie
[11:00] Brown a fraction of a second is the
[11:03] difference between a home run to right
[11:05] field or a foul ball in the bleachers
[11:08] for me timing means two different things
[11:11] first it means finding people when they
[11:13] are most likely to leave secondly it
[11:17] means finding people that really are
[11:20] going to have a pinion to join a company
[11:23] at your stage and uplevel your team for
[11:26] where you are today so let's talk about
[11:29] timing we analyze some of those aiv
[11:32] League companies to see their retention
[11:35] rates if you're on this slide I'm sorry
[11:37] if the if the information uh offends you
[11:39] at all but anthropic is leading the pack
[11:43] with about a 66% 4year retention rate
[11:46] while perplexity hovers around 44% or so
[11:51] 43% this is just a small slice of the
[11:55] world as is constantly changing but the
[11:58] reality is understanding retention helps
[12:01] you know when you're likely to be able
[12:04] to get someone to answer that message
[12:06] that you send to them it effectively
[12:08] creates a poach ability score so to
[12:10] speak of your ability to land that
[12:13] person but in addition to retention we
[12:16] actually study the behavior of different
[12:18] Generations they act
[12:21] differently in 2023 nearly
[12:25] 27% of all gen Z left their job
[12:30] if you compare this with Gen X that's
[12:33] actually more than two times as much as
[12:36] Gen X and if you were to look at the
[12:39] fact that within four years after
[12:42] graduating gen Z has about 2.2 jobs
[12:46] whereas Gen X has
[12:48] 1.1 and so some of this has to do with
[12:52] the fact that genz is actually getting
[12:54] promoted at a slower rate some of it
[12:56] might be causing those slower promotions
[12:58] some of it has to do with the layoff
[13:00] Market that took place over that period
[13:02] of time but if you ask me a lot of it
[13:05] has to come down to the penchant for
[13:07] people to take risk and bet on
[13:10] themselves j z likes that
[13:15] risk but it's not just retention and
[13:18] it's not just the generation you were
[13:19] born into you need to know when people
[13:22] work at different companies being on the
[13:26] New York Knicks in 1973
[13:29] is very different from being on the New
[13:31] York Knicks in
[13:32] 2018 one of those teams held up a
[13:35] championship trophy and the other team
[13:37] had the worst record in their franchises
[13:39] history so as signal fire we built this
[13:42] cool tool we call it historical
[13:44] composition and it actually shows all of
[13:47] the startups that we invest in a
[13:49] snapshot of the companies that they
[13:51] admire at different points in time what
[13:54] did their org structure look like at
[13:56] that point in time who are the sales
[13:58] leaders that took them from 1 million to
[14:00] 10 million who were the first three
[14:02] Engineers on their team when they
[14:04] shipped that key product that I'm trying
[14:06] to beat now these things are going to
[14:09] help you
[14:10] identify the risk profile people have
[14:13] are they going to join a company at your
[14:14] stage it's going to Mo like help you
[14:17] understand the motivations that they
[14:18] have but it's also going to help you
[14:20] understand whether they're a potential
[14:22] 10x higher which you need to make in
[14:24] order to take your company to the next
[14:26] stage so the takeaway here is that you
[14:29] have to understand timing both from an
[14:31] Outreach and an impact standpoint you
[14:34] should know when your competitors or the
[14:36] companies that you admire most are
[14:38] likely to lose other people you should
[14:41] track the people that work at those
[14:43] companies profiles to see whether there
[14:45] are changes made to it over that period
[14:47] of time studying the patterns of
[14:50] different Generations or segments of the
[14:52] population will help you understand how
[14:55] they change jobs and finally you you
[14:59] need to know when people join and leave
[15:01] companies because that will help you
[15:03] identify your 10xers and help you
[15:05] identify people that are likely to join
[15:07] company at your stage now this is where
[15:10] I finally get to use that literature
[15:11] degree narrative one of my favorite
[15:14] writers Kurt Von has this awesome
[15:16] visualization for the shape of stories
[15:19] if you look at the bottom left here on
[15:21] the xais you have beginning and end and
[15:24] on the Y AIS you have ill Fortune
[15:26] leading up to Good Fortune so the bottom
[15:28] left here is bronze kafka's
[15:30] metamorphosis Gregor samso wakes up a
[15:32] bug and everything goes downhill from
[15:35] there on the top right you have a man
[15:37] walking down the street and he falls
[15:39] into a pothole but then he works him uh
[15:42] works his way out but my favorite is
[15:43] Cinderella she's on the bottom right
[15:45] over here things start pretty crummy for
[15:47] her sisters are evil she has to do a
[15:49] bunch of work then uh some magic happens
[15:51] and she gets invited to this ball meets
[15:53] a beautiful man they fall in love and
[15:56] then what happens the clock strikes 12
[15:59] she falls off a cliff but then through a
[16:01] series of fortunate events things lead
[16:03] to Eternal bliss now I'm not telling you
[16:06] that you need to preach the depths of
[16:08] Despair that your company is in or has
[16:10] gone through but you do need to
[16:13] understand the triumphs that you've had
[16:16] why you are where you are today where
[16:19] your Arc is going the reason for that is
[16:23] because historically pay and Equity were
[16:27] the two components that we use for
[16:29] narrative but we can't rely on those
[16:31] solely
[16:32] anymore why from November 2022 to
[16:36] November 2024 we saw a
[16:39] 1.6% increase in the average tech salary
[16:43] and a precipitous decline in the amount
[16:45] of equity granted but I have some really
[16:48] bad news for the folks in this room it's
[16:50] even worse for ai ai Engineers are the
[16:53] hot ticket for this year they command a
[16:57] 5% salary premium and 10 to 20% Equity
[17:01] premium over other engineering roles so
[17:04] what was already expensive is getting
[17:07] even more expensive for us so if we rely
[17:10] our entire narrative on that we're
[17:12] relying on things that we might not be
[17:14] able to afford so salary as a sole
[17:17] selling point has got to
[17:20] go Equity was that other thing that we
[17:22] used to dangle to get people to buy into
[17:25] what we were doing as a company but
[17:27] we've seen a precipitous decline in the
[17:30] amount of people that are exercising
[17:32] vested
[17:33] shares in Q2 of 2024 33% of people
[17:39] exercised the shares that they had
[17:41] vested this is down from
[17:43] 55% a couple years earlier a lot of this
[17:47] is driven by concerns over uh valuations
[17:50] that might be a little bit too high
[17:53] concerns about the cost of liquid
[17:55] Capital to exercise these shares and
[17:58] concerns about the market shifting which
[18:00] it does every 3 weeks in AI Equity can't
[18:03] be the only other thing that we're
[18:05] relying
[18:06] on we have to get to a point where we're
[18:11] not just focusing on money and Equity we
[18:15] have to have things like a close-knit
[18:18] environment with working with the
[18:20] founders collaborative teams speed and
[18:23] the lack of friction to actually get
[18:25] stuff done a big mission the ability to
[18:29] grow your mind and your career
[18:31] opportunities markets that are
[18:34] exploding and solving complex problems
[18:37] you need to understand what all these
[18:40] things are for your company in order to
[18:42] not rely wholeheartedly on salary and
[18:45] Equity as a narrative so to summarize in
[18:48] a world where so many companies are
[18:51] fishing in the same engineering Pond
[18:54] recruiting data can give you an edge
[18:57] these are just a few examples but in the
[18:59] same way that you use data to build your
[19:01] product both your models and the kind of
[19:04] analysis of that product you should be
[19:06] assessing data to build your team your
[19:08] team is your most valuable product that
