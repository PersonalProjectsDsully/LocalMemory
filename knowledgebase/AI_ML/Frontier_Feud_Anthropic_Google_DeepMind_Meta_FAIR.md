## Summary

# Summary of "Frontier Feud" Video Transcript

## Overview  
The video features a competitive game show hosted by Barr Yaron from Amplify, where AI professionals from companies like **Anthropic**, **Google DeepMind**, **Meta FAIR**, and **Thinking Machines** compete by guessing answers to questions based on a survey of 100 AI engineers. The game involves rapid-fire questions, team collaboration, and buzzer-based responses, with topics ranging from influential AI researchers to model selection criteria.

---

## Key Points  
- **Game Format**:  
  - Teams (e.g., John, Tina, Colin, Petra) compete by guessing answers to survey-based questions.  
  - Correct answers earn points; incorrect guesses risk strikes or losing turns.  
  - Questions include topics like "most influential AI researcher" and "top considerations when choosing a model."  

- **Notable Topics Discussed**:  
  1. **Most Influential AI Researchers**:  
     - Guesses included **Jeff Hinton**, **Sam Altman**, **Yann LeCun**, and **Yoshua Bengio**.  
     - The survey results highlighted researchers like **Jeff Dean** and **Andrew Ng**, with some names (e.g., **Ilia Sutskever**) being less common.  

  2. **Model Selection Criteria**:  
     - **Price** was the top answer, surprising some participants.  
     - Other factors included **latency**, **accuracy**, **safety**, and **eval benchmark scores**.  

  3. **Team Dynamics**:  
     - Players strategized by passing or playing, with some teams using humor (e.g., "cheating frud" jokes).  
     - The game emphasized quick thinking and collaboration.  

---

## Quotes  
- **"Price is the number one answer which actually surprised me."** – Participant (highlighting the unexpected focus on cost in model selection).  
- **"Jeff Dean is not on the board"** – Participant acknowledging a missed guess.  
- **"We need a specific name"** – Clarification during a guess.  

---

## Actionable Insights  
1. **Prioritize Cost in AI Model Selection**: The survey emphasized **price** as a critical factor, suggesting budget constraints influence decision-making.  
2. **Recognize Key Researchers**: **Jeff Hinton**, **Yann LeCun**, and **Yoshua Bengio** remain central figures in AI, though newer names like **Jeff Dean** also emerged.  
3. **Balance Technical and Practical Factors**: While **accuracy** and **safety** are vital, **latency** and **cost** are equally important for real-world applications.  

--- 

## Additional Notes  
- The transcript appears fragmented, with some names and phrases (e.g., "Ilia Nom shazir Noom shazir") unclear or incomplete.  
- The game highlights the intersection of AI research, industry priorities, and team collaboration.

[00:00] [Music]
[00:17] welcome to Frontier Feud so I'm your
[00:20] host uh bar yourone I'm a partner at
[00:23] amplify we the First Investors in
[00:25] technical Founders and I invest in data
[00:27] and AI companies I'm very excited to be
[00:30] here Frontier feuding in my favorite
[00:33] City New York City and today on stage we
[00:36] have some amazing folks competing for
[00:38] prizes and eternal glory and all that
[00:40] good stuff so we're going to introduce
[00:43] our teams uh do not let these smiling
[00:46] faces deceive you we are here to compete
[00:49] uh before we do intros for the teams
[00:51] just an audience feeler who here in the
[00:53] audience including those on stage have
[00:56] watched Family Feud before quick show of
[00:58] hands
[01:00] most people for those of you uh who
[01:03] haven't the premise is pretty simple the
[01:05] nuances you'll learn with the game so we
[01:07] surveyed 100 AI Engineers on a series of
[01:12] questions folks on stage are going to
[01:14] guess the answers to those questions and
[01:17] the most popular answers from the survey
[01:20] are going to get the most points so feel
[01:22] free to follow along and guess yourself
[01:24] in the audience as we go along uh if you
[01:27] don't like the answers you can look to
[01:29] your left and look to your right and
[01:30] blame your neighbors no I'm just kidding
[01:32] in all seriousness thank you so much to
[01:33] everyone who filled out that survey
[01:35] before and so we're going to do some
[01:37] quick intros um we have on my left M you
[01:40] can kick it off tell us who you are what
[01:42] you do and your Tech hot take we're
[01:44] going to do quick
[01:46] intros cool hey everyone my name is m
[01:48] here uh I work at anthropic um my tech
[01:52] hot take is I think uh let's say have
[01:55] the fiveish people training big models
[01:58] today at least one of them will no
[02:00] longer be training AI models by the end
[02:02] of the
[02:03] year mic drop but really mic pass so
[02:07] John hi guys I'm John I work at
[02:10] anthropic and my tech hot take is I
[02:13] think AIS make really good
[02:18] therapists hi I'm Tina um I work at
[02:21] reflection AI it's a startup building
[02:23] coding agents and my tech hot take is
[02:25] that everybody working in our industry
[02:27] should spend like 20 minutes a day with
[02:29] just a pie pce of paper and a pencil um
[02:31] and think like non AI interrupted
[02:34] thoughts thank
[02:39] you hi I'm sha I'm the product lead for
[02:42] the Gemini developer apis working with
[02:45] paig uh I have two my first tech hard
[02:48] take is a followup from Tina's I think
[02:50] it'll be important for people to do what
[02:53] Tina said because eventually when you
[02:54] have ai models representing you they'll
[02:57] need some good content to be trained on
[03:01] I think I'll save my next one for later
[03:04] I love it excellent Paige you want to
[03:06] start your side heck yeah greetings
[03:09] everyone we on the stage did not get to
[03:12] vote in the survey so just be aware that
[03:14] uh we did not pregame it no fraud no
[03:17] fraud um uh my name is Paige I work at
[03:21] Google deep mine leading uh engineering
[03:23] for AI deell team um uh and I guess my
[03:28] tech hot take is is that uh speed
[03:31] forward ahead a year and a half I think
[03:34] that the majority of deployed models
[03:36] will be on device um and we'll be seeing
[03:40] a trend more towards smaller models um
[03:42] that are uh kind of orchestrated
[03:45] together maybe uh hypers specialized for
[03:47] a specific task um as opposed to relying
[03:50] just on larger models um and sending
[03:52] data elsewhere to do interesting
[03:56] things uh my name's Colin uh you might
[03:58] remember me from my talk earlier today
[04:01] I'm a researcher at augment code
[04:02] building AI coding tools before that I
[04:04] was at Fair Facebook AI research here in
[04:06] New York on working on AI for board
[04:08] games I I just had to get out both hot
[04:10] takes since I had two two ones so one is
[04:13] that in the future dating apps will be
[04:15] our AI dating each other um two is I
[04:19] don't think Transformers are the final
[04:21] architecture because eventually we'll
[04:22] build these models using biological
[04:25] materials oh
[04:27] snap hi my name is Petra
[04:30] I'm the product manager of factuality
[04:32] for the AI answer at the top of the
[04:33] Google search page my hot take is that
[04:37] um chatting with uh one bot oneon-one is
[04:40] boring and in the future most
[04:43] conversations will have at least two
[04:44] other bots in the in the room with you I
[04:47] love it hello uh I'm Stephen uh I'm
[04:51] joining thinking machines soon um and my
[04:54] hot take is that if you think we're
[04:56] hitting a token wall that sounds like a
[04:59] skill issue to
[05:01] me I love it amazing so with that let's
[05:04] get started I'm gonna have Paige and
[05:06] Mahir join me not that you're so far
[05:08] from me excellent great so the objective
[05:12] is like hit this as fast as possible
[05:14] right yes okay so so um so whoever
[05:18] buzzes first has the first chance to
[05:21] answer this question so I'm going to ask
[05:24] a question and we'll take it from here
[05:27] so we asked 100 AI engineers name the
[05:30] most influential AI researcher God dang
[05:32] it I looked at the screen okay what's
[05:35] your what's your guess uh Ilia
[05:39] satar okay we have Ilia Nom shazir Noom
[05:44] shazir very influential but not on the
[05:47] board not in our not in our top eight
[05:48] answers so your team decides if to play
[05:51] or
[05:53] pass all right we're GNA play You're
[05:54] Gonna Play You're Gonna Play okay
[05:56] awesome so John it's it's your turn to
[05:58] guess someone okay get another person
[06:00] but you can stay
[06:01] there we're working at The Kinks
[06:07] influencer cheating
[06:11] frud
[06:15] Andre answer good
[06:18] answer all right Tina how about you Jeff
[06:21] Hinton oh an excellent one but
[06:33] H oh sorry did you say Jeff Hinton yeah
[06:40] oh that's on
[06:43] me um I thought you said something else
[06:46] great I the the the lead author on the
[06:49] Transformer paper the attention all you
[06:52] need paper we need we need a specific
[06:54] name
[06:56] sorry um
[07:00] sorry I'm having a literal like I know
[07:02] the name but I uh I'm having a literal
[07:06] like uh we're gonna
[07:10] have yeah I think but we we you already
[07:12] had a strike that doesn't count so we're
[07:14] gonna we keep it we're netting at one go
[07:18] [Music]
[07:19] here I'm gonna say yan laon yan laon we
[07:23] do have Yan
[07:25] laon okay why do we keep going we just
[07:28] keep going because you're winning oh
[07:30] until we lose yeah until you lose oh I
[07:32] didn't
[07:34] I uh wait if you want to lose here's
[07:37] your OPP
[07:38] bani uh no so not on the board
[07:45] okay um what was the question
[07:48] again good question so name the most
[07:51] influential AI researcher um I'm going
[07:53] to say sam Alman Sam Alman it's a good
[07:56] one it's not on the board oh that ironic
[07:59] and so s we are on three strike so your
[08:01] team needs to
[08:02] deliberate and if you pick an answer you
[08:05] actually steal the
[08:15] points we have four options on the
[08:22] board and for those who are joining the
[08:24] question is we asked 100 AI Engineers
[08:27] name the most influential AI research
[08:33] all right I'm giving you a five
[08:36] four you're good all
[08:40] right um I'll do Jeff
[08:44] Dean um Jeff Dean is not on the board
[08:48] which
[08:50] is what I had registered earlier um okay
[08:54] so that goes to uh Roo's basilisk
[09:00] and we're GNA go what were the rest yeah
[09:03] I'll show you yeah I'll show you the
[09:05] rest of
[09:06] them so these were the ones that were
[09:09] guest we also have Andrew in we
[09:13] have we have f f Lee and we have yosua
[09:19] Benjo there is a longtail very
[09:21] influential researchers too but they
[09:24] they're only eight spots so all great
[09:26] guesses okay next
[09:29] all right uh I think John and Colin what
[09:34] is yeah you want to know the question
[09:37] yeah patience so name the top
[09:41] considerations when choosing a
[09:43] model oh I think your's is
[09:45] broken I think he
[09:48] first more
[09:50] [Laughter]
[09:54] [Music]
[09:56] passion uh come aggressively this team
[09:59] well yes name the top considerations
[10:01] when choosing a
[10:03] model
[10:17] intelligence I'm going to be very
[10:19] literal very smart answer very smart
[10:22] answer
[10:24] MH you have an opportunity to to guess
[10:28] uh safety
[10:31] safety uh is actually not on
[10:37] here and so why don't we get uh Tina and
[10:40] Petra to
[10:42] guess am I next yeah oh um
[10:47] price so cost is the number one answer
[10:51] which actually surprised me I don't know
[10:53] if like maybe raise of hands if you
[10:54] would have guessed price now you know so
[10:56] hindsight's 2020 that wouldn't have been
[10:58] obvious to me but means that you guys
[11:00] will continue with this answer and we'll
[11:02] we'll we'll continue from
[11:04] there latency
[11:08] latency uh
[11:16] yes uh eval benchmark
[11:21] scores I some of these things are
[11:24] ambiguous but I'm going to put it under
[11:28] don't don't kill me accuracy performance
[11:31] [Music]
[11:41] okay that's like
[11:46] everything okay um uh the CEO the
[11:51] CEO good answer good answer good answer
[11:55] good moving on Oh I thought because we
[11:59] Miss oh no we your te got it um like
[12:02] where the the model is being served like
[12:04] if it's on Prem or you know uh no we're
[12:07] not going to count that one but it's a
[12:08] good answer okay this team has an
[12:10] opportunity to steal these
[12:14] points I hear some folks in the audience
[12:17] think they're ready to steal
[12:19] so I love that about you I love the
[12:24] confidence oh my God
[12:43] we can make a guess that was no it
[12:45] wasn't uh open source versus closed
[12:49] Source okay so with that you guys get 63
[12:53] points cuz you stole the stole the
[12:55] points by
[12:56] getting so it's a pretty close game
[12:58] going into the third and final
[13:02] question yeah EXC all
[13:07] right
[13:09] sorry I know everyone everyone wants the
[13:11] an who has like very strong upper body
[13:13] strength so so here here are the
[13:18] answers oh capabilities yeah these are
[13:22] the
[13:24] answers great thanks for keeping me
[13:26] honest everyone in the audience and
[13:28] everyone here so all right next so who
[13:32] do we have coming up Petra and Tina
[13:34] incredible you can do it so both in the
[13:37] front Okay this requires uh Power is
[13:41] what we've learned so um are you ready
[13:45] ready yeah okay we asked 100 AI
[13:48] Engineers name a buzzword
[13:51] sorry it's okay I'm not offended but
[13:53] name a buzz word everyone in AI is tired
[13:55] of
[13:56] hearing agents agents
[14:00] what do you all think
[14:06] yes okay but you still have an
[14:08] opportunity to guess because you could
[14:09] get the number one answer oh okay
[14:19] um but you have to guess
[14:23] now I'm giving you three two one sorry
[14:28] um
[14:30] okay so it's going to go to this
[14:32] team and um uh sha it goes to you we
[14:39] asked 100 AI Engineers name a buzz word
[14:40] everyone in AI is tired of
[14:52] hearing I'm going to start my five four
[14:56] multimodality multimodality
[14:59] uh we do not have
[15:03] multimodality but I don't know where
[15:05] this strike came from so first
[15:07] strike uh I'm GNA go with
[15:12] co-pilots co-pilots gu what do we think
[15:15] he asked or no to co-pilots that's a
[15:16] very good
[15:18] guess I think it's a good okay good
[15:21] answer good answer uh but
[15:27] no AGI
[15:30] AGI okay what what does the audience
[15:32] think
[15:34] AGI all right it seems like we think
[15:36] it's a good answer and no just kidding
[15:38] yes the number one answer
[15:41] hii all right
[15:44] Tina oh
[15:48] um deep
[15:49] [Laughter]
[15:53] seek no no deep seek so this team has an
[15:56] opportunity to steal
[16:00] but you're right maybe maybe for like
[16:01] the
[16:05] week yeah you're back you're so
[16:10] back safety
[16:13] safety so unfortunately safety is not
[16:16] one of the
[16:19] answers so the these were the additional
[16:21] answers people here are sick of rag and
[16:24] prompt
[16:25] engineering um but what this means is is
[16:29] that we have a winner which is Roo's
[16:32] basilis but amazing amazing work by paig
[16:36] attention and the mixture of experts and
[16:38] so we're going to move to the fast money
[16:39] round do you guys have two
[16:45] Representatives all right you two are
[16:47] going and that means John leave the
[16:50] stage I'll call you when you're
[16:52] ready all right we're moving into fast
[16:55] money and uh so some of you have seen
[16:59] Family Feud but we're playing fast money
[17:02] the goal is for the two of them together
[17:03] to get to 200 points uh you have Mah
[17:06] here 20 seconds to answer five questions
[17:09] uh if you can't think of anything just
[17:11] say pass and we can come back to it at
[17:13] the end or never um and if you hear a
[17:16] buzzer sound let me check that it
[17:19] works beautiful your answer wasn't one
[17:22] of the surveyed questions so you can
[17:23] keep asking or or move on all right are
[17:26] you ready y okay
[17:29] uh name an AI tool that Engineers love
[17:34] cursor uh name the sorry I didn't start
[17:37] the
[17:41] clock name the job most at risk of AI
[17:44] disruption software Engineers name the
[17:47] most influential AI paper in history
[17:49] attention is all you
[17:51] need name the biggest nightmare for AI
[17:53] engineer at 2
[17:55] a.m. uh Hardware failure
[18:00] okay so we got through four but they
[18:01] were good ones so name an AI tool that
[18:04] Engineers love you said cursor cursor is
[18:08] the number one answer
[18:10] EXC we asked name the job most at risk
[18:13] of AI
[18:15] disruption you said software
[18:17] engineering that is the number three
[18:20] answer we asked name the most
[18:22] influential AI paper in
[18:25] history what do you think demolished
[18:29] attention is all is by far the number
[18:31] one answer uh name the biggest nightmare
[18:33] for AI at 2
[18:36] am. failure Hardware
[18:38] failure you know what we'll give it
[18:42] we'll give it as info problem okay okay
[18:46] yeah um and so you're going into the
[18:48] round 140 points you want to tap tap
[18:50] John in
[18:59] John ran away he got scared no there we
[19:03] go
[19:04] amazing incredible so John big things
[19:08] you have 25 seconds and you got to stand
[19:10] back there you have 25 seconds to answer
[19:12] five questions um and if you can't think
[19:15] of anything just say pass and we'll come
[19:17] back to it if we have time at the end uh
[19:19] if you hear a buzzer sound it means that
[19:21] either your answer wasn't isn't on the
[19:24] board or M's already answered it you
[19:27] ready yep um okay and I'm going to start
[19:30] your
[19:32] timer name an AI tool Engineers
[19:35] [Music]
[19:38] love oh um
[19:42] CT um name the job most at risk of
[19:45] disruption um
[19:48] artists
[19:50] uh name the most influential AI paper in
[19:53] history uh Transformers is all attention
[19:56] is all you
[19:57] need okay so we have model apis which
[20:04] is uh the third answer on the board we
[20:08] have name the job mode you said you said
[20:10] artist so I'm going to give you content
[20:14] creationwriting it's a little
[20:16] ambiguous and attention is all you need
[20:19] was already uh selected by Mahir but
[20:22] well I'll let you pick the next question
[20:23] which is name the biggest nightmare for
[20:25] AI engineer at 2 a.m. someone wrote In
[20:28] Cold email from a VC so I will talk to
[20:32] after uh uh Cuda SS Cuda SS okay well
[20:35] you know what your teammates because you
[20:37] think alike and you think you you think
[20:39] of great answers so let me just show you
[20:40] the number one answers here which are a
[20:43] cursor data entry for the job most at
[20:45] risk of AI disruption attention is all
[20:48] you need the the top paper so that was a
[20:50] good one just already taken the biggest
[20:52] nightmare an outage of the model or
[20:55] otherwise and an industry that would
[20:57] benefit the most from a My
[21:00] Healthcare uh so with that we have well
[21:04] you lost the 200
[21:06] points but I think that you're still
[21:10] winners and you're all winners and we
[21:12] have a few prizes outside that I think
[21:15] someone is
[21:16] bringing
[21:18] so we have a massive llama for this team
[21:21] we have rainbow lamba beanie babies for
[21:23] everyone we have ai engineering books
[21:26] and gift cards to your favorite
