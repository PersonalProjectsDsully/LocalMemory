## Summary

# Summary of "Cooking with Fire Without Burning Down the Kitchen: Dominik Kundel"

## **Overview**  
Dominik Kundel, from Twilio, discusses strategies for managing AI innovation while mitigating risks. He emphasizes the importance of balancing "sustaining" and "disruptive" innovation, using the metaphor of "cooking with fire" to highlight the need for caution and agility in AI adoption. The talk focuses on Twilio’s approach to AI-driven customer engagement, prototyping, and preparing for future disruptions.

---

## **Key Points**  
1. **Twilio’s Role in AI Innovation**  
   - Twilio’s team acts as a "Skunk Works" unit, prototyping solutions to bridge customer data platforms and communications platforms.  
   - Focuses on creating a "customer engagement flywheel" by iterating quickly with customer feedback.  

2. **Sustaining vs. Disruptive Innovation**  
   - **Sustaining Innovation**: Incremental improvements for existing customers, predictable, and aligned with current business models.  
   - **Disruptive Innovation**: High-risk, high-reward, often targeting new markets or unmet needs. Requires agility to adapt as quality evolves rapidly (e.g., AI advancements).  

3. **AI Adoption Challenges**  
   - **Enterprises**: Prioritize sustaining innovation due to established customer bases but risk overlooking disruptive trends.  
   - **Startups**: Leverage disruptive AI (e.g., chatbots) as a value driver, not just cost-saving.  

4. **Disruptive AI Trends**  
   - Examples like ChatGPT and Perplexity have forced incumbents (e.g., Google) to adapt rapidly.  
   - Twilio’s team focuses on anticipating disruptions to stay ahead or lead in the space.  

5. **Prototyping with AI**  
   - Used Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to bridge unstructured (e.g., chat logs) and structured customer data.  
   - Developed prototypes like the **AI Personalization Engine** to enhance customer engagement.  

---

## **Important Quotes/Insights**  
- *"Cooking with fire without burning down the kitchen" – Balancing AI innovation with risk management.*  
- *"Disruptive innovation is the opposite: you don’t know what it will be, and you often won’t make money initially."*  
- *"The biggest difference between sustaining and disruptive innovation is the quality—and quality changes every day."*  
- *"Startups see AI as a value opportunity, not a cost-saving measure."*  

---

## **Actionable Takeaways**  
- **Prioritize Disruptive Innovation**: Actively monitor emerging AI trends to avoid being outpaced by competitors.  
- **Prototype Rapidly**: Test solutions with customers early and iterate based on feedback.  
- **Leverage RAG for Data Integration**: Use AI to bridge unstructured and structured data for better customer insights.  
- **Separate Sustaining and Disruptive Teams**: Dedicate resources to both types of innovation to maintain agility.

[00:00] [Music]
[00:13] thanks everyone for joining let's start
[00:15] with a quick raise of hands how many of
[00:17] you in the last two years gotten into
[00:20] AI right that's a that's a pretty good
[00:22] amount and how many of you were in the
[00:24] room when your boss was like okay so
[00:26] what are what is our plan about AI what
[00:28] do we do about AI
[00:30] all right that was that was pretty much
[00:32] me last year um so in the next 20
[00:36] minutes time time permitting should be
[00:39] exactly 20 minutes um we're going to
[00:41] talk about our team at twio our history
[00:44] lessons we've learned around uh you know
[00:47] our team and how we operate within the
[00:49] company the role we play and to ensure
[00:52] sort of that twiller can keep up with a
[00:54] rapid pace of
[00:55] AI or in other words how do we you know
[00:58] cook with fire without burning down the
[01:00] kitchen and uh upsetting our
[01:02] customers um as Peter said my name is
[01:06] Dominic kundle I lead product and Design
[01:08] Within a small team at Tulio called
[01:10] emerging Tech and Innovation um we're a
[01:12] team of 16 people uh cross engineering
[01:15] product design and go to market and we
[01:17] try to operate as self-contained as
[01:19] possible um outside of our two more
[01:22] traditional trolo business units around
[01:24] Communications that is more focused on
[01:25] sort of the API that toio is known for
[01:28] around SMS voice email Etc and then our
[01:31] customer data platform that is more
[01:33] focused on providing a holistic uh
[01:36] overview of your customer so you can
[01:38] appropriately engage with them and our
[01:40] team itself is focused on exploring what
[01:42] the future of customer engagement is
[01:43] going to look like um with an eye
[01:46] towards emerging Technologies like
[01:48] AI but we're not the AI team within twio
[01:52] um at twio we sort of see AI as a
[01:55] feature that spreads across all of our
[01:57] products to help engage customers to
[02:00] better uh it helps our customers to
[02:03] better engage with their customers and
[02:06] um you might have seen sort of our like
[02:09] customer AI Billboards around that is
[02:11] really sort of the vision around that is
[02:13] how do we use AI to better Empower
[02:15] people uh to engage with our
[02:18] customers so we have innovation in the
[02:20] name though so are we the only ones
[02:22] innovating at twio then um the answer is
[02:24] also no um
[02:27] generally the every it's everyone's job
[02:29] to in but I think there's two types of
[02:31] innovation if you've read the innovators
[02:33] dilemma this seems familiar to you but
[02:35] basically uh there's sort of the
[02:37] sustaining Innovation and the disruptive
[02:39] innovation sustaining Innovation is
[02:41] really teams trying to innovate on top
[02:44] of their existing product and their
[02:46] existing customer needs that is sort of
[02:48] often more the iterative one it's like
[02:50] Sony trying to make a mirrorless camera
[02:52] better and like really innovating in
[02:54] that space um while disruptive
[02:56] innovation is often initially in its
[02:59] infinite stage much worse in quality
[03:02] it's actually a characteristic of
[03:04] disruptive innovation is the uh poor
[03:07] quality that often does meet the need of
[03:09] a niche audience though so think about
[03:11] cell phone cameras when they initially
[03:13] came out nobody would leave their camera
[03:15] at home go on vacation and be like I'm
[03:16] going to take pictures on this like
[03:18] Motorola um but these days like most
[03:21] people don't even have a camera a camera
[03:23] anymore they like I just went on
[03:25] vacation and only took my phone um the
[03:29] exciting thing about AI is that
[03:30] Innovation is really happening on both
[03:32] ends of the spectrum we see both sort of
[03:36] augmentation of existing workflows like
[03:39] you know photoshop's generative fill um
[03:42] a lot of what Apple announced was baked
[03:44] into ex existing products right it
[03:46] wasn't a hey here's a new AI thing but
[03:49] it was more built into the features so
[03:51] that's more on the sustaining Innovation
[03:53] side while I would say agents especially
[03:55] and gpts in general are more on the
[03:57] disruptive side um because the reality
[04:00] is agents are not ready for Enterprise
[04:03] prime time um primarily because the
[04:05] quality is not there yet right like
[04:07] we've we've all seen sort of uh agents
[04:09] going rogue partially even rag based
[04:11] chatbots like not even agents like you
[04:14] know hallucinating things like the
[04:16] example of selling you know Chevy Tahoe
[04:18] for a dollar or you know Air Canada's
[04:21] chap B making up a policy and so because
[04:24] of all of that and overall the lack of
[04:27] clarity in the regulatory space often
[04:30] within Enterprises the adoption right
[04:32] now is dictated by uh legal more than
[04:35] product teams um and so overall we're
[04:40] seeing sort of a lack like like it's not
[04:42] ready for the prime time the other
[04:44] aspect of it is um for a lot of
[04:46] Enterprise They See AI as a cost-saving
[04:48] method and agents are not cheap yet
[04:51] right like we can do increasingly better
[04:53] like rag based chat Bots um for low cost
[04:56] but like agents are still not in the
[04:58] cheap level if one high quality and so
[05:01] they're at odds there the difference
[05:04] though is for startups and smbs they're
[05:06] really your Niche these days where for
[05:08] them they actually see agents as a way
[05:11] as a value at not as a cost saving they
[05:13] already know that their quality of
[05:15] customer support and and sales and stuff
[05:18] is not where you want it to be and so
[05:20] for them it's much more an opportunity
[05:23] to really add value because you know it
[05:26] can't be worse than the current
[05:28] experience
[05:29] so why am I talking about the difference
[05:31] between these two types of innovation um
[05:34] it's very natural for a business
[05:35] actually to focus on sustaining
[05:37] Innovation especially if you're the
[05:39] incumbent in the market it's you already
[05:41] have an established customer base
[05:42] they're already paying you so that's
[05:44] great um the problems are well defined
[05:46] and so overall it's much more
[05:48] predictable and you can you hopefully
[05:51] understand your Target customer while
[05:53] for disruptive innovation is sort of
[05:54] really the opposite and you don't know
[05:57] yet what it's going to be and like you
[05:59] often are not going to make money
[06:01] initially um but ignoring disruptive
[06:03] innovation right now can be more
[06:05] dangerous than ever before because the
[06:07] biggest difference between sustaining
[06:08] and disruptive innovation is the quality
[06:11] and the quality changes every day right
[06:13] like every day right now with AI there's
[06:15] massive leaps and so something that
[06:18] wasn't quite there from a quality
[06:19] perspective yesterday can be there
[06:21] tomorrow and in a similar way a company
[06:23] that is not your concern tomor yesterday
[06:25] can be tomorrow I think the best example
[06:28] of this is the impact that chat GPT and
[06:30] perplexity and similar things had on uh
[06:32] how Google approaches search right now
[06:34] we have ai overview and things like that
[06:38] um and so our team right now is focused
[06:41] on this disruptive innovation aspect
[06:43] that's sort of where our Innovation as
[06:45] uh perspective comes from is we want to
[06:47] understand what is going to be
[06:48] disruptive to twio and how do we um
[06:52] prepare for that react quickly or be the
[06:55] disruptors in the space and inform the
[06:57] rest of the company about our learnings
[07:00] but that wasn't our original agenda our
[07:02] original agenda was we were founded as a
[07:04] three-person Skunk Works team last year
[07:06] that was really focused on uh special
[07:09] projects and trying to rapidly prototype
[07:13] the bridge between our customer
[07:15] engagement uh like our customer data
[07:17] platform and our communications platform
[07:20] to create this customer engagement fly
[07:22] wheel that I was talking about and to do
[07:25] this in a way of quickly rap uh quickly
[07:27] prototyping Solutions showing them to
[07:29] customers getting feedback understanding
[07:32] what is their Vision where are they
[07:33] going to go not just their current
[07:35] problems and then iterate on that and we
[07:37] found geni was actually a natural like
[07:41] fit for
[07:42] us uh because the biggest thing about
[07:45] customer engagement is you're sort of
[07:47] sitting between unstructured
[07:49] Communications data and structured
[07:51] customer data and nobody wants to chat
[07:53] with a Json object and like your
[07:55] unstructured data is not very helpful to
[07:58] for analysis
[08:00] and really large language models are
[08:02] perfect to bridge this they're great at
[08:04] creating this connection and translating
[08:07] structure to unstructured and vice versa
[08:09] and so as a result we dove into Pro
[08:12] prototyping our first two solutions in
[08:14] that space and that's what got us into
[08:16] the AI space uh we had conceptualized
[08:19] essentially two features that we showed
[08:21] to customers iterated on and ultimately
[08:24] hand it off to R&D to take to Market um
[08:28] one of them was the AI personalization
[08:30] engine which is a rag on top of this
[08:31] customer profile that is within segment
[08:34] and then the AI perception engine that
[08:36] was more focused on how do you take
[08:39] Communications data and then translate
[08:41] that into a customer profile because
[08:43] within a conversation there's so much
[08:45] Rich information that you want to
[08:47] remember about a customer right and
[08:49] sometimes a human agent will take notes
[08:51] somewhere but like realistically want to
[08:53] have one Central spot so we
[08:55] conceptualize these two systems and sort
[08:58] of together they make this custom
[08:59] customer memory um but as we showed them
[09:02] to leadership and they handed them over
[09:04] to R&D we did hit our first Challenge
[09:07] and that was that we had conceptualized
[09:09] something that wasn't sustaining
[09:10] Innovation was disruptive innovation it
[09:12] was uh a problem that whether quality
[09:15] was not quite there the cost was not
[09:18] quite there and primarily we were
[09:19] solving a niche use case like what we
[09:21] had made up was uh primarily helpful for
[09:24] this upand cominging wave of agents and
[09:27] generative AI Solutions in general but
[09:29] there wasn't a large market for this yet
[09:32] and so even though we had great feedback
[09:35] we didn't really have the momentum that
[09:37] helped us to prioritize this among the
[09:40] sustaining Innovation and uh
[09:43] profitability Focus that our R&D teams
[09:46] had and so we learned from that that
[09:49] even though our customer Obsession was
[09:51] key because it helped us understand that
[09:53] we were on the right track we knew from
[09:56] talking to them that this wasn't just a
[09:57] problem they were trying to solve today
[09:59] it was a problem that they were going to
[10:00] solve uh tomorrow what wasn't working
[10:03] was we had to build ideas out further to
[10:06] be able to gain that traction and uh be
[10:08] able to hand it over to
[10:10] R&D and so we started working on our
[10:13] next project called AI assistance which
[10:15] is an agent Builder that is built on top
[10:16] of this customer memory concept um and
[10:19] it's designed to really allow you to
[10:21] build Omni Channel customer engagement
[10:24] chat Bots uh and we started with the
[10:26] same principles we tried to really
[10:28] rapidly prototype quickly get something
[10:30] into the hand uh like to show to
[10:32] customers get feedback get a working
[10:34] demo continue to iterate on it as we're
[10:37] getting feedback both internally and
[10:39] externally but we did a couple of things
[10:41] differently this time one um we decided
[10:45] we have to get this into the hands of
[10:46] people as soon as possible what we had
[10:48] built previously was primarily demo
[10:50] driven it was what can we show to
[10:52] customers and get feedback based on that
[10:54] and so we changed our mode and ran
[10:56] internal hackathons Tred to give it give
[10:59] really rough access to really rough
[11:01] prototypes with all the rough edges to
[11:04] customers coming into the office and
[11:06] we're like here's for one day you have
[11:07] access to this prototype let us know
[11:10] everything that is wrong with it and
[11:11] what you want it to do um and this was
[11:13] both terrifying and Incredibly uh you
[11:16] know um insightful for us and uh
[11:20] additionally we tried to find more
[11:21] opportunities to do dog fooding we tried
[11:23] to find ways we can solve problems
[11:25] internally we started with a low uh
[11:27] lowrisk use case around it help desk we
[11:30] knew it wasn't the perfect Target
[11:33] customer that we would expect to buy our
[11:35] solution but it was a way for us to
[11:37] gather data and see what the quality
[11:39] challenges were and how we wanted to
[11:41] structure things and then we started to
[11:44] establish an engineering organization
[11:45] that would actually be able to set the
[11:47] foundation for us to actually take this
[11:50] into the hands of people but that
[11:52] brought us to the next challenge because
[11:54] at toio we've worked hard over the last
[11:56] couple of years to really build the
[11:58] foundation to um in our software
[12:01] development life cycle to really create
[12:03] trust with customers in what we're
[12:05] launching and gen really changed how you
[12:08] develop AI products right it's actually
[12:11] exciting but also tricky for larger
[12:13] companies because gen turned sort of the
[12:16] entire product development life cycle on
[12:18] its head where in the past you had to
[12:20] gather a lot of data you had to make
[12:22] sure you had enough data to train a
[12:24] model you trained the model until you
[12:26] reached a certain level of quality then
[12:28] you released it and then you started
[12:30] optimizing these days you can actually
[12:32] use gen to build a prototype or often an
[12:35] MVP very rapidly without having that
[12:38] data and release it out to some
[12:40] customers to get feedback and then
[12:43] continue to iterate on that but that
[12:46] puts us into a dilemma because we have a
[12:49] system now that we know is not quite
[12:52] there from a quality perspective but we
[12:54] need to get it in front of people to
[12:56] make it better and so how do we do that
[12:58] and how do we keep up with a pace of
[13:01] Technology Without Really upsetting
[13:03] customers with something that doesn't
[13:06] meet our normal Quality Bar and so
[13:08] that's where we looked around the
[13:09] industry for other examples uh the two
[13:11] that came up for us were getup next uh
[13:14] the creators of gith up co-pilot and
[13:16] then uh cloudfl emerging Technologies
[13:18] and incubation that created things like
[13:20] workers and uh D1 and workers Ai and
[13:23] both of these were really focused on
[13:25] setting the appropriate expectations uh
[13:28] around for users around reliability
[13:30] capabilities and
[13:31] availability and so our solution for
[13:34] this was to create our own sub brand
[13:35] cult fio Alpha that was very focused on
[13:39] um you know setting the right
[13:41] expectations with customers but enabling
[13:43] us therefore to ship early and ship
[13:45] often engage the interest from customers
[13:48] outside of those that we would have to
[13:49] otherwise track down and enable
[13:51] customers to come to us um and so that's
[13:54] learning number two to ship early and
[13:56] ship often so that we can regularly like
[13:58] get rapid feedback from customers slides
[14:01] are oh
[14:03] no they just
[14:19] yeah mine still thinks it's
[14:23] connected no now it's gone
[14:39] y cool um so that got us to our second
[14:44] learning about shipping early and
[14:45] shipping often um because by having a
[14:48] sub brand it allowed us to open weight
[14:50] lists for developer previews show our
[14:52] offerings and onboard people quickly as
[14:54] well as have internal poc's to learn
[14:57] while we're onboarding people but
[14:59] everyone talks about shipping fast so
[15:01] like you know how fast like especially
[15:03] with sort of the the rapid pace of AI
[15:06] like how do we ship fast enough and the
[15:08] honest answer is we haven't figured out
[15:10] yet what is fast enough but we put some
[15:12] base principles in place that help us
[15:14] move fast one was around how we grew the
[15:16] team as we started hiring people we
[15:19] focused on C curiosity and creativity
[15:22] because at too we've always valued the
[15:26] creativity of developers to solve not
[15:29] just coding but business problems in
[15:31] fact our co-founder Jeff Lawson wrote a
[15:32] whole book asked your developer about it
[15:35] and so for us using that like having
[15:37] Natural Curiosity within the team was
[15:39] more important than existing AI
[15:41] experience because we wanted everyone to
[15:43] be able to solve problems rather than
[15:45] relying on product to figure out what is
[15:48] the thing we're building we wanted to
[15:50] give problems to to the engineers and be
[15:52] able to figure out what we're going to
[15:54] build uh the other thing we put in place
[15:56] is flexibility both in terms of our
[15:59] systems we assume that every model that
[16:01] we're using is going to be redundant
[16:02] tomorrow that doesn't mean that we're
[16:04] jumping on every model that comes out in
[16:06] every paper but instead we understand
[16:09] what are our known limitations and how
[16:11] do we and every time a model comes out
[16:14] how do we quickly validate whether the
[16:16] next model is something that helps us in
[16:18] that moment so for example when 3.5
[16:20] Sonic came out we were able to figure
[16:22] out within a day whether we wanted to
[16:24] pay any attention to this for now or
[16:26] whether we're putting it in the backlog
[16:29] the other side is flexibility of road
[16:30] map having a new team that is
[16:33] specifically focused on Innovation
[16:34] helped us not have any preexisting
[16:37] commitments to customers and allowed us
[16:39] to really have flexibility about the
[16:41] road map and we try to defend this
[16:43] flexibility as much as we can with uh
[16:46] with current initiatives around this the
[16:49] big part around this I would recommend
[16:51] is to understand that expectations are
[16:54] shifting at any moment currently meaning
[16:57] figure out what are expectations that
[16:59] are staying because those are worth
[17:00] putting on the road map those that are
[17:02] Ever Changing you need to have more
[17:04] flexibility around think about the
[17:06] difference between trust and safety
[17:07] where people are uh you know always
[17:09] going to be focused on versus
[17:11] multimodality where um every time some
[17:14] new uh new mode comes out people are
[17:17] going to change what they want want to
[17:19] have like most people don't talk about
[17:21] image these days anymore but like that
[17:23] was the hot thing like a few months ago
[17:24] now everyone talks about voice um so you
[17:27] will constantly have to iterate on your
[17:28] road map and you have to be okay with
[17:31] failures um but if you're okay with
[17:34] failures especially in the environment
[17:36] right now where everyone in the company
[17:38] and most companies like has to provide
[17:40] value at all times how do you provide
[17:42] that value uh while you're waiting for
[17:45] your eventual home run um that's where
[17:48] we made sort of the last mistake that I
[17:51] want to call out where as I mentioned
[17:53] our team is self-contained within the
[17:54] company um including having our own goto
[17:57] market and in the first first year we
[17:59] took that self-containment a bit too far
[18:01] um we basically just operated in our own
[18:04] Corner quietly and shared what we were
[18:06] working on on a need to know basis both
[18:09] with customers but also internally and
[18:11] that resulted in uh often teams not even
[18:15] knowing that we existed as a team or
[18:17] what we were working on and it was on us
[18:19] to find potential conflicts or
[18:20] collaboration opportunities and at the
[18:23] same time our customers were having the
[18:25] same questions that we had around what
[18:27] are we doing about AI you know and it
[18:30] really especially for a B2B company you
[18:32] have the opportunity to help your
[18:34] customers be thought leaders in their
[18:36] space and build a stronger Bond so our
[18:39] third learning was to share things as we
[18:41] go both internally and externally
[18:43] internally to find Opportunities to
[18:46] share all that enormous learnings the
[18:48] the enormous learnings that we had with
[18:50] others to empower them but also
[18:53] externally to enable others be to be
[18:55] thought leaders in in their
[18:56] space so these are our big learnings
[18:59] from the three uh you know from the last
[19:02] year and we actually ended up turning
[19:03] them into our base principles for the
[19:05] team so being customer and developer
[19:08] obsessed to make sure that we talk to
[19:10] customers early and often and understand
[19:12] not just you know their current problems
[19:14] and their current problems with twio but
[19:16] understand their business their
[19:18] challenges in general and their vision
[19:20] for customer engagement so that we can
[19:22] anticipate their future needs uh
[19:24] shipping early and often so that we can
[19:26] set the right expectations
[19:29] um with them but still get things into
[19:31] their hands and get feedback from them
[19:34] and creating a team that is curious and
[19:36] owns problems so that we can actually
[19:38] build things quickly and then lastly
[19:40] Shar as you go uh share Shar as we go so
[19:43] we're both sharing internally as much as
[19:45] we can but also sharing externally um to
[19:48] help our customers be thought leaders
[19:50] and with that um thank you so much for
[19:53] your attention I will put like the
[19:55] slides are already on that yourl if you
[19:57] want to check them out and Peter
