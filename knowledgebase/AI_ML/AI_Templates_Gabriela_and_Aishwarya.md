[00:00] [Music]
[00:14] thank you so much for coming my name is
[00:16] Gabriela deero uh I work at Microsoft as
[00:21] you can tell I'm director of AI working
[00:24] on uh with startups and doing events
[00:28] like this Outreach talking to Founders
[00:30] and then I have Ash my colleague hi I'm
[00:33] a senior R adviser with Microsoft
[00:35] startups so pretty much spending my day
[00:37] today talking to Startup helping them
[00:39] build their their AI Tech stack
[00:42] primarily on Azure but like no
[00:44] BMS uh I'm Pamela I'm a python Cloud
[00:47] Advocate just on
[00:50] this and uh I spend most of my time
[00:53] working on open source repositories like
[00:55] the ones we'll be using today and then
[00:57] also doing live streams and conferences
[00:59] and all that sort of fun stuff like
[01:01] here awesome so uh we'll have a lot of
[01:05] like handson but before that we are
[01:07] going to set the stage share a few
[01:10] things and we have the instruction so
[01:11] everybody will follow so today we are
[01:14] going to talk about the AI template so
[01:17] it's a way for you to run your AI
[01:20] application in
[01:21] minutes uh and the agenda is more or
[01:23] less like this we are going to talk
[01:25] about Microsoft for startups something
[01:27] that we call Founders Hub and then the
[01:29] partner ships the um the then the AI
[01:32] template and then we go to the Hands-On
[01:34] Workshop how many of you have heard of
[01:36] Founders
[01:38] Hub one two okay okay uh well uh we have
[01:45] something called Founders Hub where we
[01:48] offer you a bunch of things uh not only
[01:52] credits but a bunch of other things that
[01:54] I'm going to talk about and the sign up
[01:56] process is very easy it takes you like
[01:58] less than five minutes um it doesn't
[02:01] matter where you are in our stage if you
[02:03] only have an idea or if you already have
[02:05] a startup and you are Incorporated it
[02:07] doesn't matter if you have funding or
[02:09] not funding at all um and there are like
[02:14] several cool things about this platform
[02:16] the founders help platform of product uh
[02:18] you have the benefits piece but you also
[02:21] have one of my favorite pieces which is
[02:23] like the guidance so you have oneon-one
[02:26] um calls with experts you ask technical
[02:30] questions to like anything like go to
[02:33] market or like how do I go about my
[02:36] strategy anything that you can think of
[02:37] that you can leverage uh and then there
[02:40] is something new and Ash please chime in
[02:44] uh if I'm missing something but there is
[02:45] something new that we added to the
[02:46] platform which is called build with AI
[02:49] and that's where we are going to be
[02:50] focusing um it is a open- source piece
[02:54] it's all on GitHub but you can access
[02:56] through the founders Hub which again is
[02:58] the Microsoft first startup platform
[03:00] that everybody can sign up and and and
[03:03] join uh one of the cool things is like
[03:07] you get a lot of credits right so like
[03:09] everybody likes free credits especially
[03:12] when you are trying things out um and we
[03:16] offer up to up to
[03:19] $150,000 in Azure credits that you can
[03:21] use across Azure services including
[03:25] which not a lot of people know Azure
[03:27] openingi so we have the same open AI
[03:31] apis on Azure with the whole security
[03:34] compliance capabilities of
[03:36] azure plus a lot of like other benefits
[03:39] like GitHub Enterprise Products uh
[03:41] Microsoft 365 LinkedIn prman and more uh
[03:45] and then you can use uh Azure for
[03:46] example Azure AI Studio you can use
[03:49] models from opening eyes as I mentioned
[03:51] by llama and others uh so one of the
[03:55] main slides if you are looking for
[03:57] credits guidance and so on this is like
[04:00] the place where you take a picture and
[04:02] you get the URL and you apply in
[04:06] minutes
[04:08] um do you want to talk about a little
[04:11] bit about more about the cloud credits
[04:13] uh yeah I think one of the most
[04:14] important things that I
[04:16] would okay one of the most important
[04:20] things that I personally like about the
[04:21] entire Microsoft startups program it's
[04:23] not quantitative it's not just that we
[04:25] th we're throwing out a bunch of credits
[04:27] at you and you're like build it yourself
[04:29] or like you know figure it out yourself
[04:31] there is a lot of cross collaboration
[04:33] that's happening so for example like we
[04:35] spoke about gp4 GPT 3.5 turbo Etc right
[04:38] our product team work very closely with
[04:40] the startup so if there is any um
[04:42] private preview happening we are working
[04:44] personally with startups to have them on
[04:46] board to for them to like try out these
[04:48] products give us feedback that hey this
[04:51] is something this is one of the feature
[04:52] capabilities I would like to have and
[04:54] that gets like passed on to the product
[04:56] team for them to work on there is my
[04:58] team which is AI advised which is
[05:00] working on with startups one-on-one so
[05:03] you're getting like expert advice and as
[05:05] a startup I think like getting advisors
[05:08] getting time timely advice getting like
[05:11] timely uh resolutions is really really
[05:13] important and those are the qualitative
[05:15] benefits that I personally feel is
[05:17] really important when you're working
[05:18] with Microsoft for startups it's not
[05:20] just AI advice you can get a bunch of
[05:23] different um experts by by you like
[05:26] there is a there's a tool within
[05:28] Founders have which helps you match with
[05:30] different experts you have a question
[05:32] about infrastructure you have a question
[05:33] about kubernetes you have a question
[05:35] about how do I think about like my goto
[05:37] Market how do I price my subscription
[05:39] model there could be a ton of different
[05:41] things that a startup is going to be
[05:43] doing and you don't have enough
[05:44] resources to help you with that and
[05:46] that's where you get experts from
[05:48] Microsoft who are working in a variety
[05:50] of different products to help you
[05:52] navigate these challenges so think about
[05:54] the qualitative benefits and the support
[05:57] that you're getting apart from just the
[05:59] credits so that's that's something I
[06:01] would like to add yeah and then uh we go
[06:05] with you throughout all the stages if
[06:07] you only have an idea or if you are
[06:09] building if if you are in the scale uh
[06:12] phase as well so it's for any startup at
[06:14] any stage um as I mentioned we are
[06:18] helping with all the Cutting Edge AI
[06:20] tools and helping you streamline the AI
[06:24] development and then we have something
[06:26] like very special as well which is go
[06:29] goes beyond the founders Hub which the
[06:31] partnership that Ash is going to touch a
[06:32] little bit so one of the things I was
[06:35] talking about right Founders Hub is a
[06:37] platform that becomes like an intake for
[06:39] all the startups this becomes your like
[06:42] if any of you are like familiar with
[06:44] like YC's platform or like Port portal
[06:46] right similar to that like we have
[06:48] Founders Hub as a portal which has like
[06:50] end to endend everything it keeps track
[06:52] of how much credits you have consumed
[06:54] what are the products that you've been
[06:55] using what are the benefits that you've
[06:57] gotten it's not just the Azar credits
[06:58] there's a ton of like third party
[07:00] credits that you get and productivity
[07:02] tools that you get for free and as a
[07:04] startup you need all of these tools to
[07:06] like help you build that ecosystem so
[07:08] that's one of the most important things
[07:10] now as a startup you're getting started
[07:12] at Founders Hub that's why you get like
[07:14] the $150,000 in credits as you grow in
[07:17] your journey if you're getting involved
[07:19] with one of the Microsoft strategic VC
[07:21] Partners which includes M12 y combinator
[07:25] Neo alt Capital Al chemist to name a few
[07:28] then you get a bunch oft extra credits
[07:30] so outside of the $150,000 you get an
[07:32] extra credit which becomes total of
[07:34] $250,000 in credits and then you get
[07:36] like um startup development managers who
[07:39] are like you know dedicated Cloud
[07:41] Solutions Architects to work with you
[07:43] Pegasus program is another uh Elite
[07:46] level uh partnership program that we
[07:48] have with startups which helps them go
[07:50] to market which helps them get you
[07:52] onboarded on aure Marketplace if you
[07:54] need help like you know to amplify what
[07:56] you're doing so you're coming in telling
[07:59] us that hey Microsoft help us reach your
[08:02] like you know millions of uh viewers or
[08:03] like millions of people who follow you
[08:05] on your LinkedIn page or on your blog
[08:07] and help us amplify our startups so we
[08:09] do blog pieces with you we do video
[08:11] interviews with you we do YouTube
[08:13] interviews with you which helps you
[08:14] amplify that product outside of that
[08:16] we're also getting startups involved in
[08:19] conferences so uh Microsoft takes up a
[08:22] lot of like speaking slots at
[08:24] conferences and we get our startups that
[08:26] we're working with come and talk about
[08:29] their product on stage we have we have
[08:31] one for example nla is coming to talk
[08:33] about their product and they got um
[08:37] integrated to Azure so you can run the
[08:39] time gen uh uh that they have so they
[08:42] are coming to talk yeah so exactly like
[08:46] so it's a lot of like amplification that
[08:47] you're getting from Microsoft
[08:49] perspective as
[08:52] well yeah um I think we briefly covered
[08:55] about some of the pain points uh I'll
[08:57] give you like a quick tldr right as as a
[08:59] startup if I'm building a startup I
[09:01] really do not have a lot of time uh to
[09:04] like spend two weeks on getting a
[09:06] support ticket cleared off right like I
[09:09] need quick Solutions I need really
[09:12] really fast experimentation Pace I want
[09:14] to try out different things different
[09:16] tools different models very quickly and
[09:18] then decide for myself what's the best
[09:20] fit for me and that's one of the places
[09:22] where uh one of the pain points that
[09:24] we've heard from startups is that hey
[09:26] it's really hard to go through like tons
[09:28] of documents ations and figure out how
[09:30] to get started like the first Quick
[09:32] Start program uh to like run a
[09:34] particular application it takes us weeks
[09:37] all together to run our first end to-end
[09:39] application that's the solution that we
[09:41] wanted to Target with AI templates so
[09:44] and one of the M major disclaimers it's
[09:46] not 101 level examples these are really
[09:50] really complex examples so one of the
[09:51] ones that we're going to be showing is
[09:53] Rags with AI search so the these are
[09:55] really complex examples that you can run
[09:58] within minutes and that's that helps
[10:01] startups get started very quickly and
[10:04] run these applications customize it as
[10:06] they want because it's open source any
[10:09] of the issues that you're facing just uh
[10:11] put it on GitHub and then it'll get
[10:13] resolved we have uh we have an entire uh
[10:15] Cloud Advocate team working on these
[10:17] templates if you have any requests that
[10:19] hey help us with this particular other
[10:21] template we we here to help you on
[10:26] that all right so now it's the fun part
[10:29] so now we are going to be doing like
[10:32] handson uh we have the setup instuctions
[10:35] in in this URL you can go over there or
[10:39] or scan the QR code and we are going to
[10:42] go through all the setup instuctions
[10:43] actually Pamela is going to go for
[10:47] right okay well let's make sure
[10:49] everybody has this URL because you are
[10:51] going to actually want to have that doc
[10:53] open so it's
[10:56] aka.ms e-workshop or you can scan the QR
[11:00] code and it should open up a document
[11:03] that looks like the little screenshot
[11:04] there that says uh you know quick start
[11:06] with AI templates with setup
[11:08] instructions and if you have any trouble
[11:11] any issues we are three so you can hate
[11:15] raise your hand and then we'll go and
[11:17] help
[11:18] you does anyone not have the dock URL
[11:23] yet still working
[11:27] okay we need to just have a whiteboard
[11:29] remember whiteboards whiteboards were
[11:32] great yeah this is the Whiteboard do you
[11:33] think they'll mind if we just did you
[11:35] bring spray paint I get some okay great
[11:37] thanks all right we good all right okay
[11:40] just holler at us because we're we're
[11:42] I'm going to step through it first so
[11:44] you still have time but we want to make
[11:45] sure you all have that dock okay all
[11:47] right I just remembered how PowerPoint
[11:49] works okay all right so um okay so if we
[11:52] look at that those
[11:54] instructions um the first thing is that
[11:57] we you do need a GitHub account uh so if
[12:00] for whatever reason you don't have a
[12:02] GitHub account yet this is a good time
[12:04] to get it you should be able to get it
[12:06] for free and if you do have a GitHub
[12:08] account just make sure you are logged
[12:10] into your GitHub account and what we
[12:12] provided today for this Workshop is two
[12:15] different things that are going to help
[12:17] you uh deploy these templates so one is
[12:20] an Azure pass so this is really cool
[12:23] because normally things cost money um
[12:25] but we're giving you an aure pass which
[12:27] will create a Azure subscription fore
[12:29] which will give you up to $50 worth of
[12:31] credits and it will expire in seven days
[12:35] so I guess you can keep working with it
[12:36] for the next seven days and it'll
[12:39] certainly give you enough to get started
[12:41] during this Workshop so that's really
[12:42] cool so none of none of you should have
[12:44] to worry about any of this costing you
[12:46] money um we don't want we don't want
[12:48] that to happen and then the other thing
[12:50] that we've got you is U normally when
[12:52] you're using as your open AI you have to
[12:55] sign up to get permission to use it you
[12:57] actually have to go fill in a form and
[13:00] get approved for it and uh get your
[13:03] account opened up for it so since it
[13:05] takes time to fill up that form and the
[13:07] reason we do this is for responsible AI
[13:08] reasons we want to make sure people are
[13:10] using a your open AI for good reasons
[13:11] which is good I like I like that about
[13:14] Microsoft um but it does take time so we
[13:16] have set up this a your open aai proxy
[13:19] that all of you will be able to use
[13:21] during this Workshop so you're going to
[13:23] use it as your pass so that you can
[13:25] freely deploy these things and then the
[13:26] as your open a i proxy so you don't have
[13:29] to worry about getting permission to use
[13:31] it uh so that's what a lot of this setup
[13:34] is so the first step is to get that pass
[13:37] setup so I'll
[13:40] demonstrate uh from here let me go to my
[13:49] Firefox okay so when you go to this as
[13:52] your check-in link uh it's going to ask
[13:55] you to log in with GitHub so then I can
[13:58] say log in with GI
[13:59] Hub uh oh let me do it in my I've got
[14:02] three browsers open right now here we go
[14:04] let's do it in
[14:06] Chrome
[14:11] yeah request is blocked uh
[14:14] oh is is was anybody else able to open
[14:17] the dock yeah trying EV okay yeah the
[14:21] Wi-Fi was oh sometimes you mean maybe
[14:24] the Wi-Fi is bad it misinterprets it
[14:29] it could also just be that the URL was
[14:30] slightly wrong uh I think that's what
[14:32] happens for AA
[14:34] links okay all right cool so then that
[14:39] has a link to this check-in website so
[14:41] on the check-in website we see that it
[14:44] has two options either create a GitHub
[14:45] account if you don't have if you don't
[14:47] have what or just log in with GitHub so
[14:48] I'm going to click login with GitHub and
[14:51] there we go I was already logged in in
[14:52] this browser and then you'll see this as
[14:55] your pass so this is just a a promo code
[14:58] that you're going to use for the next
[14:59] stage and you can copy the clipboard and
[15:01] there's this button here that says get
[15:03] on board with
[15:04] Azure so when you click on that then you
[15:07] get brought to this screen
[15:10] here and uh it says what Microsoft
[15:13] account I'm currently signed in as so it
[15:16] you know so at this point you have to
[15:17] figure out what Microsoft account you
[15:18] want to use uh so you could make up a
[15:20] new one you can just like make a new
[15:21] outlook address I made one this morning
[15:23] it's no big deal uh you could use a
[15:25] Gmail account um I don't recommend using
[15:28] your work account if you do have a work
[15:30] account disc work accounts tend to have
[15:31] a lot of restrictions on them and I just
[15:34] think things will not work out so I
[15:36] recommend some sort of personal account
[15:38] either create a a brand new Microsoft
[15:40] Outlook account today or just use your
[15:42] Gmail um whichever those you you want to
[15:45] do um so you do need to be logged into
[15:47] some Microsoft account so it says okay
[15:49] I'm going to be logging in with my Gmail
[15:52] I confirm I enter the promo code here
[15:57] and then I have to do this horrible I
[16:00] don't like what is oh okay dvw
[16:05] okay okay and then in this case I got an
[16:08] error and that's because I did already
[16:09] redeem my pass uh for this for this
[16:12] account um but you should get a success
[16:14] if you haven't redeemed your pass for
[16:16] the account yet and then that should
[16:18] give you set you up with this new
[16:20] subscription in your aure portal so you
[16:22] can see here now on my pam. foox
[16:25] gmail.com I've got actually two
[16:27] subscriptions CU I'm actually a paying
[16:29] user of azure so this is my uh paid
[16:31] Azure subscription you can see I'm
[16:33] spending $40 this month and then here's
[16:36] my uh sponsorship which I you know won't
[16:38] be paying for um so that's and if you're
[16:41] doing a brand new account you're only
[16:43] going to see this sponsorship here so
[16:45] that's the expected flow uh to being
[16:49] able to get set up with this as your
[16:52] pass uh you don't have to do it right
[16:54] now you could wait until we you know
[16:56] break into Hands-On time uh because then
[16:59] it probably is easier for us to walk
[17:00] around in case there's any issues and
[17:02] just to be careful make sure that in the
[17:03] next step whever you're using the
[17:05] subscription ID you use it for the Azure
[17:08] sponsorship one and not the other one or
[17:10] you're going to get built on your um on
[17:11] your credit card yeah yeah so if you're
[17:13] worried about that just make a whole new
[17:15] account that's what I have in my let's
[17:17] see that's Firefox so
[17:19] in um in this account uh in my other
[17:23] browser this is an account I made uh
[17:26] this morning uh with just a new Outlook
[17:29] account Pamela Fox aif Far outlook.com
[17:31] it's pretty good all right and that one
[17:34] only has in this case I only have the
[17:37] sponsorship Yeah
[17:47] question I see okay so how many of you
[17:50] have sons with Minecraft all right uh
[17:52] probably best I saying that is why I
[17:54] used a whole new browser not my normal
[17:56] browser um so did it already if you
[17:59] already granted you the pass I just went
[18:01] with you know it came up with my email
[18:04] address that and then it takes me to my
[18:08] account but there's nothing here that
[18:10] says anything about Azure and when I put
[18:12] in
[18:22] Azure do you do don't have number if you
[18:26] don't have
[18:30] uh I don't think it makes you it
[18:31] shouldn't make you oh to get a whole new
[18:33] Outlook
[18:34] account once
[18:45] I okay I didn't remember that step maybe
[18:49] we can just give him our
[18:53] number okay so if anyone else is having
[18:56] trouble let me know I can help
[18:59] yeah do we want to just get through this
[19:00] stage now or how do we want to do it
[19:04] sure like do you want to like see what
[19:06] other issues everyone has yeah
[19:48] so um how many folks are working on
[19:50] getting the AZ your past redeemed right
[19:52] now are people working on that now
[19:57] okay and how how many of you have
[19:59] actually successfully gotten it yeah
[20:01] okay good good okay cool okay so just
[20:06] get do
[20:16] that so should I move on at some point
[20:19] or should we wait like a five
[20:23] minute okay all right so we'll spend
[20:26] five minutes getting through this step
[20:29] and answering any questions so uh so go
[20:32] ahead if you haven't yet you know try to
[20:34] get your as your pass redeemed and uh
[20:37] we'll just make sure we have enough time
[20:39] to get that redeemed for
[20:45] everyone you can pretty much use any
[20:47] account like your University account
[20:49] personal account just not work account
[20:51] just not work account would the
[20:52] university account still be okay because
[20:54] University tenants sometimes have
[20:55] restrictions too don't they
[20:59] can try I've used my University account
[21:01] it works fine okay so with these ones
[21:04] yeah with this one yeah okay with the
[21:06] one yeah no with these
[21:09] templates okay it might not work um do
[21:13] you all remember if we need to add the
[21:15] address and all of that I don't remember
[21:17] when the Azure
[21:18] pass you you have to okay so you have to
[21:22] wait so how did he get over the number
[21:23] stage I just like asked him toenter
[21:25] phone number starting 646
[21:30] all
[21:34] right the next step is the
[21:53] proxy we'll see until Gabriella is out
[21:56] of questions
[22:06] yeah uh raise your hands if You' got
[22:07] that pass in we're just trying to
[22:10] see okay activated it on aure
[22:14] okay
[22:18] okay yeah no oh question
[22:29] yeah so
[22:31] you you went
[22:57] this for
[23:35] we'll show that next yeah so to confirm
[23:38] that you have the
[23:39] Azure thing working you can go to
[23:42] portal. azure.com and then it's going to
[23:44] look super empty you'll see nothing
[23:47] under resources but if you click on
[23:49] subscriptions then that's where you
[23:51] should see as your past sponsorship so
[23:53] your subscription is basically like it's
[23:54] kind of like a billing account sort of
[23:56] thing um so that's that's how you know
[23:59] you've got it is if you see that under
[24:02] your portal under
[24:07] subscriptions all right so let's try now
[24:10] let's look at the proxy okay so for the
[24:13] proxy that's another URL which is linked
[24:15] from the docs um so I'll go ahead and
[24:19] open that I think I've already logged in
[24:21] on this
[24:23] one okay so what you're going to see is
[24:26] this page that looks like this and it
[24:29] has this login with GitHub so then I log
[24:31] in with
[24:34] GitHub and now I'm logged in you can see
[24:37] it says welcome to my GitHub username at
[24:40] the top and when I scroll down I can see
[24:43] an API key and an endpoint so here's the
[24:46] API key and here is the endpoint so this
[24:50] is what we're going to be using in order
[24:52] to interact with open AI as your open AI
[24:57] models um
[24:59] and we'll just have to specify this key
[25:01] in this endpoint when we're using the
[25:03] template so you're going to basically
[25:05] like you just keep this open so that you
[25:07] can continually copy and paste these two
[25:09] Fields here just like create a small
[25:12] note where you're like you have your
[25:14] subscription ID your endpoint and your
[25:16] key copy pasted on that yeah and declare
[25:19] by normally I don't recommend using API
[25:22] keys and I've got all these like videos
[25:24] and blog posts about how you should
[25:25] never use API keys because when you're
[25:27] actually using AZ your AP uh open AI you
[25:29] can do keyless authentication using this
[25:32] thing called managed identity and we
[25:33] have a talk coming up next week about
[25:35] that um but in order to use this proxy
[25:38] and um you know take care of the
[25:40] permission issue we are
[25:42] temporarily sinning and using keys okay
[25:47] uh so that's that's a proxy so you just
[25:49] have to log in and then you should get
[25:51] the info for the proxy
[25:54] okay all right so now I'm going to step
[25:58] through one of the actual templates so
[26:02] um you know all the templates are open
[26:03] source repos but we've put together
[26:05] instructions specific to this Workshop
[26:08] in in this uh readme here these three
[26:11] readmes and really specific to using
[26:13] that proxy so we're going to ramp up in
[26:16] terms of complexity so we'll start off
[26:18] one that's uh really simple like this is
[26:21] one where you you know it's uh just to
[26:23] show you how things are working and and
[26:26] get things going and then we'll move on
[26:28] on to two different rag applications uh
[26:31] that are more sophisticated and ending
[26:34] with our most sophisticated one that has
[26:36] been deployed like a 100 thousand times
[26:38] at this point by AZ your developers so
[26:40] it's a very very popular one um so let
[26:43] me start with you know this first one so
[26:47] we go to the read me and the first step
[26:52] is to open the project using GitHub code
[26:54] spaces uh has anyone here used GitHub
[26:57] code spaces
[26:59] okay a few people okay so GitHub codes
[27:01] spaces is very cool any GitHub
[27:03] repository you go to you can open them
[27:05] up in a code space so you can like start
[27:07] hacking on that repository immediately
[27:10] uh and then we can also customize like
[27:12] the environment for that so what it's
[27:13] going to open is actually a VSS code in
[27:15] the browser that has that project loaded
[27:18] in so we're going to click on here you
[27:20] know one one very cool thing about get
[27:22] Hub code spaces is like you know when
[27:24] you share something with like someone
[27:26] and they say wow was working on my
[27:28] machine but it's not working yours right
[27:31] that problem that we all have with all
[27:33] the setting the local environments and
[27:35] all of that code spaces you if you use
[27:39] code spaces you don't have that problem
[27:40] because I will have the same environment
[27:42] as Ash as Pamela so I will not have the
[27:46] problem like it's not working on my
[27:47] computer but it's working yours right so
[27:50] it's one of the pain points that Cod
[27:52] spaces came to uh solve and all of us we
[27:57] use cod spaces on the daily basis
[27:58] because setting up your local
[28:00] environment in your computer can be very
[28:01] very
[28:02] painful um so so yes does everybody have
[28:07] access to their subscription by now
[28:10] anybody was
[28:12] not okay if you're not you can just okay
[28:15] can we just like try to solve that and
[28:17] then we go through yeah okay
[28:22] cool
[28:24] Azure the proxy
[28:29] yes uh so the question is how do you get
[28:31] to the repo so there is a link this one
[28:34] yeah this's link over here uh it takes
[28:38] you to the GitHub repo with all the
[28:41] everything that you need with the code
[28:43] and everything no I can't edit yeah
[28:45] there's like a blank page skip the blank
[28:47] page and then go to the not blank page
[28:49] it can't blame on
[28:51] me I'll help you control left hands on
[28:55] so the other question was how do you
[28:57] know if you have the subcription you go
[28:58] to portal. azure.com and then you find
[29:01] subscription and then you click on
[29:02] subscriptions there we go and
[29:05] then so now um now I'm going to step
[29:09] through the instructions just for the
[29:12] quick start one and then we'll we'll
[29:15] really set everyone loose um and so that
[29:18] we can walk around so this one is yeah
[29:20] just a simple chat application so we're
[29:22] going to start off with running this loc
[29:25] well I'm going to call it local I'm
[29:27] inside GitHub code spaces which is VSS
[29:30] code in the browser in this
[29:32] containerized environment but I'm going
[29:34] to start a local server inside GitHub
[29:37] code spaces so I like to start with
[29:39] local development first when I can so I
[29:41] can like make sh sure that things are
[29:43] working and then once I know it's
[29:44] working locally then I can deploy it to
[29:47] azer so we're going to start with a
[29:50] local server inside the code space um so
[29:55] looking at the instructions here so I've
[29:56] got the project open
[29:59] uh the first step is to make a EMV so we
[30:02] have a sample here so I'm just going to
[30:04] copy and paste the stuff from the
[30:09] sample and you know the one negative
[30:11] about using codes spaces with conference
[30:13] Wi-Fi is that it is a online environment
[30:16] so if you want you are also welcome to
[30:18] try these out these projects locally
[30:20] this is just how we can guarantee less
[30:22] issues with developer environment setup
[30:25] okay so you can see in this environment
[30:27] file we need to specify the endpoint and
[30:30] the key and the deployment so for the
[30:33] endpoint we're going to go to the proxy
[30:36] page and grab that endpoint
[30:39] URL and put that here and so it looks
[30:42] like this HBS polite ground blah blah
[30:44] blah blah blah API slv1 that's what your
[30:47] endpoint should look like for all of
[30:48] these so literally the open AI SDK is
[30:51] going to send requests to this endpoint
[30:54] and you know get responses from it the
[30:57] next step is the key so we go here and
[31:00] we're going to copy and paste that key
[31:03] there's my key love
[31:06] it uh and then the deployment name uh so
[31:10] this is the name of our deployment of
[31:12] our GPT model so if any of you used
[31:15] open.com okay so on open.com you just
[31:19] use things by their model name you just
[31:21] say oh I want to use GPD 40 I want to
[31:23] use GPD 35 turbo on as your open AI you
[31:26] actually make deployments of models
[31:28] where you say Okay I want a new
[31:29] deployment of gbd 35 turbo and then you
[31:31] give that a name so we've actually named
[31:34] the deployment the same as the model
[31:36] here to make it either more or less
[31:39] confusing but that is one big difference
[31:41] between open a.com and a your open aai
[31:43] is that the a your open has this notion
[31:46] of deployments uh but everyone's going
[31:48] to put in gbd 35 turbo
[31:51] here uh so so there we go okay so I've
[31:54] got a
[31:55] EMV and the next step is to run the
[32:04] server all right so this is running the
[32:07] um the python back
[32:10] end we can open this up and so this will
[32:14] when I click on this URL inside the code
[32:17] space it'll actually open up a very
[32:19] different URL so this is the this port
[32:22] running onside the code space so it's
[32:24] got this like really funky URL so then I
[32:26] can say like right uh Hau about AI
[32:30] engineer World Fair okay I always do all
[32:35] my testing I say to write a Haiku
[32:36] because otherwise llms get really you
[32:38] know verbose and you're just sitting
[32:39] there waiting
[32:41] forever so there we go that is working
[32:44] that's getting back responses so you you
[32:46] know send any uh message that you can
[32:48] hiu about San
[32:52] Francisco and uh there we go there we go
[32:55] I actually just watched a video
[32:56] yesterday about how the gold Golden Gate
[32:58] Bridge was built it's fascinating okay
[33:01] so there we go now it is actually
[33:03] running so this is running the app
[33:05] that's inside the source folder so if
[33:07] you want to explore it you can this is a
[33:10] court
[33:12] application is anyone actually heard of
[33:14] court it's not well known okay who's
[33:16] heard of
[33:17] flask all right court is just a
[33:19] synchronous version of flask like
[33:21] literally probably flas will become cour
[33:23] at some point or vice versa so coure is
[33:25] just flas but async uh and we always
[33:28] want to use an async framework when
[33:29] we're building applications that make uh
[33:32] calls to llms because we want better
[33:34] concurrency so you'll see for all our
[33:36] samples they're all either using core or
[33:39] fast API for the python backends because
[33:42] those are the ways that we can have
[33:43] async so you'll see async if you haven't
[33:46] you know worked with async a lot in
[33:47] Python you just see async and awaits all
[33:51] over the place um because that's how we
[33:54] build uh with async backends uh but this
[33:57] is the actual code that's happening here
[33:58] we're streaming in the response from the
[34:01] open aai client and uh we're getting
[34:05] back the responses and we're streaming
[34:07] it back to the front end using something
[34:10] called Json lines or new line delimited
[34:13] Json it's just a way of streaming one
[34:15] line at a time so let me do a longer one
[34:17] just so I can show you uh how the
[34:19] streaming
[34:20] works and streaming is also another
[34:23] general practice if you're if you're
[34:24] making a user facing application that's
[34:27] making a call call to an llm you really
[34:29] want to H stream that response in
[34:31] ideally because then it's going to
[34:32] appear faster to the user because the
[34:34] time to get the first token as soon as
[34:37] you get that first token you can start
[34:38] streaming in that first token so we are
[34:40] actually streaming in a token at a time
[34:42] so like
[34:43] write uh a long
[34:46] essay about San Francisco okay so we
[34:51] should see this actually stream in
[34:56] here and uh once it so it still takes
[34:59] some amount of time to get that first
[35:00] token but then once you get that first
[35:02] token in there we go that was so fast I
[35:06] wonder if the proxy is actually making
[35:07] it be a bit different let me see if I
[35:09] can see it in the Stream what
[35:12] happened
[35:15] um I should see it in the response
[35:20] fascinating
[35:22] um normally I can see the stream tokens
[35:25] in their swans here I can try it with
[35:26] another of ours though okay all right so
[35:28] we'll have to trust that but um but yeah
[35:31] there you go so this is just our our
[35:33] getting started experience so this is
[35:35] the local server right so we are running
[35:37] the local server but we are hitting up
[35:40] as your uh as our uh you know so we are
[35:43] hitting up a cloud resource and that's
[35:45] because it's hard to have a local a
[35:48] local gbd 35 now if you want you can
[35:51] actually use these models with like AMA
[35:54] I don't know if any of you use AMA but
[35:55] AMA is a really great way to run small
[35:58] language models and so I add support for
[36:00] llama to to all my samples when possible
[36:02] so if you want locally you can actually
[36:05] run against these small local models
[36:07] like 53 or llama 2 or whatever uh it's
[36:10] just not going to be the same thing
[36:12] because they're different models but
[36:13] that is an option for local development
[36:15] all right so that's all set up the next
[36:17] step is to actually deploy this to Azure
[36:20] so that's when we are you know going to
[36:21] be using that as your account that you
[36:22] set up so first thing we have to do is
[36:25] log
[36:26] in so we're going to do a off
[36:29] login and we're going to use the device
[36:32] code flow when we're inside a codespace
[36:34] so that's going to have us copy and
[36:35] paste some uh some code here so I press
[36:40] enter and it opens up this new tab and
[36:42] I'm actually going to open this up
[36:45] in uh another browser we'll just pick a
[36:48] random one okay here we go and then I'm
[36:51] going to grab the device code here and
[36:55] then I put it into here
[36:59] sign in okay so I guess I'm using my
[37:01] Gmail here all right so I am signed
[37:06] in okay so now I've logged in so you
[37:10] want to make sure you log in with the
[37:12] account that you just set up for that as
[37:13] your
[37:14] pass then we're going to create a new uh
[37:18] ACD environment this is kind of like a
[37:20] new deployment environment so a lot of
[37:22] times when I'm developing these these
[37:23] samples I've got like 20 different
[37:25] deployment environments where I'm trying
[37:26] out different configurations and stuff
[37:29] so I'll make a new one here for this one
[37:31] chat quick start so you just give it
[37:33] give it a little
[37:35] name and then the next step is that we
[37:38] need to set some environment some ASD
[37:40] environment variables these are like our
[37:41] deployment variables that's going to
[37:43] tell the um the infrastructure how to
[37:47] provision everything so we're going to
[37:49] tell it to not make Azure openi because
[37:51] we're using the proxy we're going to
[37:52] tell it the name of our deployment so I
[37:54] can just go ahead and copy and paste
[37:56] those two things so I'll just paste them
[38:01] here okay and then I need to tell it the
[38:04] key so this is the same key that we did
[38:07] earlier but now this is going to be used
[38:08] by the actual deployment flow so I go
[38:12] and find oh I deleted way too much come
[38:16] back okay so just delete that part and
[38:22] grab the
[38:25] key all right so now I've set the key
[38:28] for deployment and then I'm going to set
[38:30] the endpoint for
[38:33] deployment
[38:34] and here we go where's that proxy at
[38:38] there we go all
[38:40] right okay so now I've set all these ACD
[38:43] environment variables these are going to
[38:45] be used when we are configuring the
[38:48] infrastructure and so then we run ACD
[38:51] up so what this is actually doing is
[38:54] that we're using this um infrastructure
[38:57] as code does anybody here use terraform
[38:59] or bicep or arm okay yeah so terraform
[39:03] is probably the more well-known one so
[39:05] at as year we have our own version um
[39:07] originally it was arm and it was Json
[39:09] now we have bicep which is like a better
[39:11] version of arm stronger uh but these are
[39:15] all our bicep files you can also write
[39:16] terraform if you want to do that I just
[39:18] I know bicep more than terraform so we
[39:20] are using bicep which is
[39:21] infrastructure's code and that bicep
[39:24] describes how everything is going to be
[39:26] made so how are we going to make the
[39:27] open AI how are we going to make
[39:29] analytics container apps uh rolls all
[39:32] that stuff all right so I need to select
[39:34] an a subscription use so I'm going to
[39:35] use the sponsorship subscription um for
[39:38] many of you you might just have one
[39:39] subscription and then a location this is
[39:41] going to be where like our container app
[39:42] is going to go so I'll just pick a
[39:45] random location
[39:47] there okay and now it is packaging
[39:50] everything
[39:52] up uh so it is yeah it's actually
[39:55] building Docker image so this one gets
[39:57] deployed to a your container apps that's
[39:59] like an a your option for running
[40:01] containerized applications we also have
[40:03] like a your app service a your functions
[40:05] as your kubernetes uh but for this one
[40:08] and the second one we're using container
[40:10] apps as a you know a nice place if you
[40:13] using Docker how many of you like
[40:15] Docker I shouldn't say like how many of
[40:17] you use Docker okay it's a simp okay you
[40:21] know I don't want to
[40:22] presume um so if you do like Docker you
[40:25] know dockerized um environments you know
[40:27] this is using a Docker file uh you can
[40:30] see the docker file here uh you know
[40:33] installing requirements running the
[40:34] server all that sort of stuff here uh so
[40:37] then is provisioning the resources so
[40:39] it's going to do that whole step and
[40:40] then I've already got one uh you know
[40:43] pre uh already deployed here so we if
[40:46] once it's deployed we'll have a
[40:47] container apps URL and this is a URL
[40:49] that you can you know tweet share
[40:51] publicly whatever try not to use up all
[40:53] I mean I guess use up all your credits
[40:54] whatever uh uh
[40:58] hi LM what's up I don't know I never
[41:01] know what to say
[41:03] um I don't have feelings thanks uh so
[41:07] now it is deployed there and then if I I
[41:09] can look at my portal and see you know
[41:12] actually see what it made so I can go
[41:14] here and look at maybe
[41:18] container apps and uh that's actually a
[41:21] different one so let me look for let me
[41:25] go I know I think I just have to
[41:27] remember which thing I I which I have
[41:30] got three different portals going right
[41:32] now here we go uh so we'll
[41:36] do
[41:38] uh a quick
[41:42] start maybe this one there we go so once
[41:46] it's all deployed you can go into your
[41:47] portal and actually find the resource
[41:50] Group that was made and then you can see
[41:52] what was made underneath it so here we
[41:53] have a container app contain to registry
[41:55] these are everything we need in order to
[41:57] make a containerized
[41:58] app so that's the flow for that one the
[42:01] flow is similar for the other ones but
[42:03] the other ones are a lot more uh a lot
[42:06] more sophisticated I'm saying like
[42:07] they're ones that people are actually
[42:08] using uh in production so I'll just talk
[42:12] about rag um rag is stands for retrieval
[42:17] augmented generation this is our
[42:19] solution for the fact that llms like to
[42:23] make stuff up I mean that's kind of
[42:24] their it's kind of their the way they
[42:26] work they're just word prediction
[42:27] machines and so if you get them to
[42:29] predict something that they don't know
[42:30] then they'll they'll go ahead and
[42:31] predict something right so how do we get
[42:33] llms to give us reliable output for a
[42:36] particular domain we can use retrieval
[42:38] augmented generation and so how this
[42:41] works is that we get in a user question
[42:43] we use that to search some sort of
[42:45] database whether it's a you know a
[42:47] search engine a vector database whatever
[42:48] you want we search it we get back
[42:51] results and then we send both the
[42:53] original user question and the search
[42:55] results to the LM and say hey
[42:57] now please answer the user question
[43:00] based off the search results and then
[43:01] you'll get a really good answer so as
[43:03] long as you have a very good search
[43:05] engine so you really want to pick really
[43:07] good retrieval mechanism search engine
[43:09] at that step because if you get good
[43:11] results then you'll get a great answer
[43:13] from the llm because LMS are incredibly
[43:15] good at synthesizing information
[43:17] summarizing uh based on what they see uh
[43:20] so they just need to have this you know
[43:22] really good search step so we have two
[43:24] different rag options that you can try
[43:25] deploying today uh and over the next
[43:28] seven days so the first one is rag on
[43:31] postgress and so this is if you like
[43:33] already had a a database imagine you've
[43:36] got like a retail website you've got a
[43:38] bunch of products that you're selling
[43:40] and you wanted your customers to be able
[43:41] to ask questions about those products
[43:43] right so you can uh you can just search
[43:47] off those table rows for you know what
[43:50] the user is asking about get back the
[43:51] matching table rows and then you pass
[43:53] those table rows to the LM and say hey
[43:56] answer this user question about the
[43:58] table rows I'll show you uh what that
[44:02] actually uh looks like when deployed
[44:04] here so here I've got you know a a
[44:07] product table for this outdoor uh
[44:10] outdoor shoe company and so the user
[44:13] puts in uh puts in a question here and
[44:16] we get back all these results and where
[44:18] they site you know this is just info
[44:20] from the rose and we can look at the
[44:21] thought process here and so we can see
[44:25] um that actually actually it's even I
[44:27] did the fancy one okay I'll use the
[44:29] simple flow first so I can show the
[44:30] simple
[44:33] flow and uh and then we'll move on to
[44:35] the advanced advanced
[44:37] rag okay all right so here now if we
[44:40] look at the thought process here we get
[44:42] the search query we use that to query
[44:44] the database so these are the rows we
[44:46] get back from the database and we do
[44:49] both a vector search and a text search
[44:51] now I'm sure you've heard lots of things
[44:53] about Vector databases they're great but
[44:55] you need Vector search and and T Tech
[44:57] search and you need to combine those
[44:58] results together if you use Vector
[45:00] search alone you will not get good
[45:02] results I've done like hundreds of
[45:04] evaluations of of this sort of thing you
[45:06] need to have a hybrid search which is
[45:08] going to do both a vector search and a
[45:10] text search so for postgress we can use
[45:11] PG Vector for Vector search and then we
[45:13] can use their built-in full text search
[45:15] for text search and then we can combine
[45:17] them together uh so we get back results
[45:20] and then we you know send it to the
[45:22] model we say hey your job is to answer
[45:25] questions based off of sources here
[45:27] here's the user question and here's the
[45:28] sources so at its simplest this is what
[45:31] rag is this is the actual call that we
[45:33] make to the model is please answer
[45:35] according to these sources here's the
[45:37] question here's the sources we get back
[45:39] the response now uh we can get a little
[45:42] fancer with that so we go to the um
[45:46] Advanced flow
[45:48] here and uh and I say it's fancy but I
[45:50] think it's actually what most people are
[45:52] are doing at this point for their rag at
[45:54] the least so in this flow here the first
[45:57] thing we do is we take the user's
[45:59] question and we rewrite it into a better
[46:02] query because user questions aren't
[46:04] really optimized for searching databases
[46:06] or searching search engines so we first
[46:08] ask an LM like hey here's a user query
[46:11] make this into a better query so this is
[46:12] what we can call the query cleanup phase
[46:14] or the query rewriting phase and it's a
[46:17] really useful first stage to have in a
[46:19] rag application and so then we get back
[46:23] uh you know search results and then uh
[46:26] well we get back the query right so in
[46:28] this case uh it actually ended up giving
[46:30] the same query in this example and then
[46:33] we get back the results and then we send
[46:34] it but this gets particularly helpful
[46:36] when we have multi-turn conversations
[46:39] like uh if I type in let's see if it's
[46:42] going to perform for me today more
[46:44] options right more options on its own is
[46:46] a terrible query to send to a search
[46:49] engine right what is more options more
[46:51] options about what so I'm hoping that my
[46:54] query rewriting phase is going to clean
[46:56] this up
[46:57] now yeah they see I should test this
[47:00] before I do it all right so I can
[47:02] demonstrate that more in um in in our
[47:05] other example because I have done that
[47:07] demo more this one's repo is a little
[47:10] fresher I made the like a month ago
[47:13] okay uh so that's what we're going to
[47:15] need for now another thing we can do in
[47:16] the queer Rew writing phase though is
[47:19] that we can actually use open AI
[47:21] function calling in order to get the
[47:23] model to generate SQL filters for us
[47:27] uh so that's what we've done here is
[47:29] that the user asked I want climbing gear
[47:31] cheaper than $30 well we can make that
[47:34] into a SQL filter so we actually asked
[47:36] the llm we use opening ey function
[47:38] calling and say hey can you tell us if
[47:40] there if we should do a price filter
[47:42] here and so it comes back and says yeah
[47:43] you should do a price it should be less
[47:45] than and 30 and then we can use that to
[47:47] construct a SQL filter so that's another
[47:49] really cool thing about having that
[47:51] first query rewriting phase is that then
[47:53] you can start doing more sophisticated
[47:55] things and and having it actually
[47:57] uh come up with more structured queries
[48:00] uh and not just do just like a full text
[48:02] um you know full text
[48:04] search okay so that's rag on
[48:08] postgress and so there we saw the flow
[48:11] of that the other one that we have and
[48:13] this is the one that's super popular
[48:15] that's been deployed thousands of times
[48:16] and this is what many people think of
[48:18] when they think of rag is being able to
[48:19] do rag on unstructured documents so
[48:22] you've got PDFs and docs and excels and
[48:25] HTML or whatever right you've got all
[48:26] these documents and you want to be able
[48:28] to ask questions about it and people are
[48:30] really excited about being able to
[48:31] finally ask questions about PDFs because
[48:33] then we don't have to open PDFs because
[48:35] nobody wants to open a PDF right so we
[48:37] can do uh we can do ragon documents and
[48:40] so that's what this demo does here and
[48:44] so let me go ahead and uh show the
[48:46] deployed version of that one right so I
[48:48] asked what does a product manager do I
[48:50] get back citations I click on I citation
[48:53] that will load in the particular page
[48:56] number that it got it from right so this
[48:58] is the PDF and the page number where we
[48:59] got it from and and this is you know a
[49:02] question that's specific to this
[49:04] particular employee handbook and we
[49:06] could do this rag with
[49:07] anything um and so here you can see the
[49:10] you know all the citations it found and
[49:12] for the thought process here it's
[49:14] similar right we have a query rewriting
[49:16] phase we have the search results phase
[49:18] and we've got the prompt to generate the
[49:20] answer so a lot of this is is really
[49:22] similar the big difference is that here
[49:25] we have to have a data ingestion phase
[49:28] because we need to figure out a way to
[49:29] take these like you know 50 Page Long
[49:31] PDFs or something and store them in you
[49:34] know in a searchable way so we have a
[49:36] data ingestion that will take a PDF uh
[49:39] we crack it using uh as your document
[49:41] intelligence which is very good
[49:42] extracting text from documents then we
[49:45] chunk it um we do a token based chunking
[49:48] so we try to come up with chunks that
[49:50] are about 500 tokens large and then we
[49:53] vectorize those chunks with you know the
[49:55] open AI embedding models and then we
[49:57] store them into Azure AI search so
[50:00] that's the data ingestion phase uh so
[50:02] you're going to need that's why this is
[50:04] the most complicated
[50:05] architecture is because of that uh that
[50:08] data ingestion phase there right so data
[50:11] ingestion we're using document
[50:13] intelligence as your storage to store
[50:15] them as your open AI to embed and then
[50:16] as your AI search to store that there uh
[50:20] but then it's really cool and you can do
[50:21] it with all sorts of things so I uh I've
[50:23] got one that has my blog in it so I can
[50:26] ask questions about myself let me get
[50:28] that one open uh let's see my blog here
[50:31] we
[50:38] go and there we go good sleep strategies
[50:42] I was just telling them how bad I am at
[50:43] sleep but I have researched it a lot
[50:45] because I'm so bad at it these are all
[50:48] from my
[50:50] blogs okay uh and that's from this is
[50:53] from parsing and like an HML site um
[50:59] yeah so there you go so those are those
[51:02] are our there's my BL uh those are those
[51:05] are the rag ones and so with um ragwood
[51:08] the Azure AI search that's one where you
[51:09] could immediately get start like get
[51:11] started with putting your own documents
[51:13] into it and seeing what it's like to be
[51:16] able to chat off
[51:19] them I
[51:22] what oh yeah good question can you put
[51:25] them somewhere yeah uh we'll put in the
[51:27] same dock okay the same word dock we can
[51:30] put the slides over there uh okay and
[51:33] I'm I'm done okay cool I know like let's
[51:36] go through the questions and then I know
[51:38] that some people were a little bit
[51:39] behind I want to make sure that you have
[51:41] something running uh of course
[51:44] everything that Pamela showed you uh
[51:46] you're are going to be able to do in
[51:48] your own time like we ran this over and
[51:51] over and over again we triy different
[51:53] things we customized the HTML of the
[51:56] chat uh we also change the the the the
[52:00] the message uh like for example one of
[52:03] the things that you can do is like
[52:04] instead of like you are AI
[52:07] assistant um I can say you only know
[52:10] about
[52:12] Nintendo any other thing just say woo
[52:16] right so you can do things like that so
[52:19] there is a lot of like customization
[52:20] that you can do on this on these
[52:22] applications uh as she was showing you
[52:25] you can use your own data she was
[52:27] showing with the data from her blog
[52:29] right uh but I want to make sure that
[52:31] everybody's more or less on the same
[52:32] page or if you have any questions like
[52:35] whoa Pamela what did you just do I have
[52:38] no idea what is rag or any questions so
[52:41] we
[52:42] can help you get up to
[52:46] speed okay
[52:50] I aure search basically but
[52:57] or you use
[52:59] something uh yeah great question so what
[53:01] um formats can it handle uh so now as
[53:04] your document intelligence can handle
[53:05] quite a few uh so we have the let me
[53:09] find the document about it um data
[53:11] ingestion okay uh so these are all the
[53:14] ones supported by di right PDF HML docx
[53:17] ppdx XLS
[53:20] images are all supported from document
[53:22] intelligence and then we built our own
[53:24] parsers for text what is what im right
[53:28] so if you put yeah that's a good
[53:30] question when you see images so if you
[53:32] send images to document intelligence
[53:33] it'll OCR them basically it'll extract
[53:35] the text now the different thing is that
[53:37] you might want to do um like a GPT
[53:40] Vision uh which is which is a whole
[53:42] different thing which is where you're
[53:43] actually asking sending an image to GPT
[53:47] like 40 and asking a question about it
[53:49] now this repo does actually opt
[53:51] optionally support that so if that's
[53:53] something interested you can try that
[53:54] out that's that's actually different
[53:56] from ingesting an image um slightly
[53:58] different process but that's that's also
[54:00] an option so it just depends what are
[54:02] your images and what are you hoping to
[54:03] get out of them
[54:14] Yeahs so document intelligence will
[54:17] extract as much as it possibly can to me
[54:20] that's sometimes too much but I did have
[54:22] an an incident where uh I did another
[54:24] one based off the python playwright
[54:27] documentation and the python playwright
[54:29] docs has some images of the node
[54:31] playwright and so it actually extracted
[54:34] the JavaScript out of those images and
[54:36] then that messed up my whole rag U
[54:38] because it did extract it so document
[54:40] intelligence will generally try to
[54:42] extract as much as it can and so if
[54:44] there are text in the images it'll just
[54:45] bring those out as
[54:50] text for search can we do more than just
[54:53] like can you have
[54:56] that as well yeah yeah so you could do
[54:59] you could add additional Fields um where
[55:02] you just mark them as searchable and
[55:04] then they would get searched as part of
[55:05] the full teex search uh so I think we
[55:07] even start off with three different
[55:09] searchable fields but you can yeah you
[55:10] can add Fields you mark them as
[55:11] searchable then they'll get searched as
[55:13] part of the full Tech search in terms of
[55:15] the vector only what you vectorize will
[55:17] be searched so if you do really want
[55:19] something to be searched in the vector
[55:21] search then you'd want to do like what's
[55:22] called like content stuffing or content
[55:24] expansion which is where you take
[55:25] everything and you stuff it into the
[55:27] same field and then you vectorize it um
[55:30] which is totally something you can try
[55:32] if you think it's going to be useful for
[55:33] Vector but I I like I have like really
[55:36] warn about vectors is that you you just
[55:38] want to be careful with your vectors
[55:39] because sometimes we like put too much
[55:41] faith in in vectors like I'll show you
[55:43] like the blog post I did uh last week
[55:46] where I ran um I ran the the the stats
[55:51] um so Vector search is not enough right
[55:53] but look at the stats uh down here
[55:56] um the thing you should do is evaluate
[55:59] so if I did this is a text only search
[56:01] it got a groundedness rating of 4.87
[56:04] which is fairly High and um I only was
[56:08] able to get 02 Improvement by moving to
[56:11] Text Plus Vector so you'll hear a lot
[56:14] about Vector but but please remember to
[56:17] use hybrid and to use good hybrid so if
[56:19] you just if you just blindly like you
[56:22] know if you just combine vector and text
[56:24] and kind of just use a basic algorith is
[56:26] the reciprocal rank Fusion algorithm
[56:28] then you'll actually get pretty poor
[56:29] results because those Vector results
[56:31] because you have to remember with uh
[56:32] when you do vectors and you do a search
[56:34] across vectors you will always get
[56:36] results because it's going to give you
[56:37] the most similar even if it's really far
[56:40] apart right so that's the danger of
[56:42] vector search is that you're always
[56:43] going to get results and those results
[56:45] might be noisy they might be distraction
[56:47] and if you distract an llm it is very
[56:49] very distractable so um yeah so so the
[56:55] best like with Az search this is the AI
[56:57] search the best results is if you do
[56:59] hybrid with their semantic ranker model
[57:01] and that's an additional machine
[57:02] learning model that actually ranks
[57:04] results according to the original user
[57:06] query and so that's the only way in my
[57:08] experience that I can use vectors and
[57:11] actually get you know get back to the
[57:13] results of a a you know better than a
[57:15] full Tech search so just a just a plea
[57:18] to evaluate and be careful with your
[57:23] vectors any any other question or do you
[57:26] want us to repeat like one of the apps
[57:30] we can go over slowly making sure that
[57:33] you are getting every little step
[57:36] because some people were having issues
[57:37] with the key and not able to run it
[57:42] uh but we can also like walk around
[57:45] right yeah yeah uh like okay I have a
[57:49] question then for you uh were a like
[57:51] were you able to get at least one thing
[57:54] running
[57:56] okay anybody didn't get anything running
[57:59] like have no idea what we are doing okay
[58:01] so we are going to help you
[58:04] um you you didn't get anything
[58:11] running okay and before that I know that
[58:15] some people will probably walk around uh
[58:17] but I really really want something from
[58:19] you all so uh one of the things that I
[58:23] want you all and you can sa for because
[58:26] this is very important for us is like we
[58:29] love feedback so we give workshops and
[58:32] talks all the time and we want to
[58:34] improve right but don't say like oh I
[58:37] wish the Wi-Fi was better sure yeah but
[58:39] it's out of control right so if you can
[58:41] take a picture I would really appreciate
[58:44] any feedback that you have for us to
[58:46] improve or to make this this is like
[58:49] very dance this Workshop like there is a
[58:51] lot uh we try to compress so you have
[58:54] like a lot of like materials that you
[58:56] can go and work by
[58:58] yourself
[59:02] um yes so I have one of the questions
[59:05] for people who are like either working
[59:07] at a startup or like want to build a
[59:09] startup or are currently a founder of a
[59:12] startup would love to know what are some
[59:13] of the use cases that you're working on
[59:16] and does it like closely relate to any
[59:19] of the AI templates that we showed today
[59:21] if not like tell us more because this is
[59:23] not the only templates this is just like
[59:25] three of the examples that we showed in
[59:27] the for the workshop there's tons of
[59:29] more AI templates available on the
[59:31] GitHub repository but for now like would
[59:35] love to learn more about like you know
[59:36] some of the use cases that you're
[59:38] working on or you're interested in
[59:40] building and maybe like you know we can
[59:42] we can answer some specific questions so
[59:45] it's is somebody interested in sharing a
[59:47] use case that they
[59:49] have you can win some
[59:51] prizes I'm
[59:54] kidding but yeah like really appreciate
[59:56] if you have any questions yeah uh any
[59:58] like
[59:59] examples uh so one thing that it's it's
[60:02] a good practice now that I'm saying is
[60:05] when you open code spaces you are paying
[60:08] for it so make sure that you either
[60:11] pause it or you delete it otherwise your
[60:13] GitHub
[60:15] account pay
[60:18] fors yeah you have 60 hours for free but
[60:21] right every month I guess but make sure
[60:24] that uh if you go github.com codespaces
[60:28] you can see everything that is running
[60:29] because I saw someone had like three or
[60:31] four or five so pay attention to
[60:35] that uh so you
[60:41] don't I don't you can you can you can
[60:44] set you can can I can I do a you can set
[60:48] up like you can say in my case if if
[60:50] it's like I'm not using for more than 30
[60:52] hours I just shut down automatically
[60:56] uh but it's something that sometimes you
[60:59] forget
[61:02] um yeah so make sure that let's see how
[61:05] many Pamela has P Pamela has a bunch of
[61:08] them running as you can
[61:09] [Music]
[61:11] see yeah so yeah quite a few people are
[61:13] actually using this in production which
[61:16] um at first we were a little surprised
[61:17] by because originally it was a sample
[61:19] but now we've really hardened it uh so
[61:22] people are using it for public facing
[61:23] stuff like um government websites using
[61:26] it because governments have lots of PDFs
[61:28] and documents and it's hard to sort
[61:30] through their stuff right so making it
[61:31] easier for citizens to interact with
[61:33] government data is one use case the
[61:36] other big one is internal HR stuff or
[61:39] internal meeting transcripts um like
[61:41] being able to look through all the
[61:42] transcripts and ask like you know what
[61:44] did the CEO say then um uh internal
[61:48] sales training manuals like there's
[61:50] there's like there's so many people
[61:52] using it for lots of things
[61:56] any time there's like new
[61:59] doation SC whatever yeah so in in terms
[62:03] of being able to automatically update
[62:04] the index like you just had it in manual
[62:07] ingestion um but you could use instead
[62:09] integrated vectorization which is an AI
[62:12] search uh option where you set up an
[62:14] indexer so you would point it at like a
[62:16] blob storage your uh blob storage and
[62:19] say hey every time this updates every 5
[62:21] minutes make sure you refresh the index
[62:23] and then it would uh refresh it uh so
[62:25] that would be one option or you could
[62:27] use like an aure function with a trigger
[62:30] and that's uh there's another another
[62:33] repo that does that uh it's the chat
[62:36] with your data solution uh accelerator
[62:39] repo and this one sets up an Azure
[62:41] function that has a trigger so um you
[62:45] we've got a few different options for
[62:46] how you could keep it updated uh people
[62:49] just figure out what's you know what
[62:51] works out for
[62:54] them thank you so much much yeah thank
[62:58] you sure
[63:03] [Music]
